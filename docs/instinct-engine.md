# The Instinct Engine

A self-improving memory layer for your second brain. It turns flat-file agent
memories (`feedback_*.md` / `discovery_*.md`) into a **confidence-weighted,
decaying, project-scoped, portable** instinct library — and captures 100% of
tool calls deterministically so pattern extraction stops being guesswork.

Before this engine, `/patterns` reconstructed "what happened this session" by
re-reading the transcript in context — probabilistic (~50-80%) and lossy — and
memories had only a categorical `strength:` (explicit / correction / implicit),
no number, no decay, no portability. The Instinct Engine adds the six things
that were missing.

> **Provenance.** The patterns here were derived from an audit of
> [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) (`continuous-learning-v2`,
> `/evolve`, `/instinct-import`) and **reimplemented clean** per the
> license-hygiene rule — pattern adopted, code original.

## 1. Confidence + decay

Every instinct carries four managed frontmatter keys (added by `backfill`,
never clobbering your existing keys or body):

```yaml
confidence: 0.90      # 0.0–1.0, effective belief in this instinct
observations: 4       # times reinforced
last_seen: 2026-05-29 # last reinforce/correct/decay date
project_id: global    # scope (see §3)
```

**Seeding** maps the existing `strength:` taxonomy onto a number:

| signal | seed confidence |
|---|---|
| `strength: explicit` (user stated it verbatim) | 0.90 |
| `strength: correction` (user corrected an action) | 0.75 |
| `strength: implicit` (inferred, unconfirmed) | 0.50 |
| no strength · `feedback_*` with hard-rule language (never / always / banned / codified / must) | 0.82 |
| no strength · `feedback_*` (a codified preference) | 0.72 |
| no strength · `discovery_*` (an audit / finding) | 0.60 |
| no strength · other | 0.60 |

Most memories never carried a `strength:` label, so the type/content seed is
what gives the engine real signal on day one. `instinct.py reseed` recomputes
this seed for instincts that have no `strength:` and have never been reinforced
(it never resets a strengthened or reinforced instinct).

**Bidirectional update** (the rule ECC states as "increases when repeatedly
observed / decreases when corrected / decreases when unseen"):

- **reinforce** — `c' = c + 0.15·(1 − c)` (climbs with diminishing returns; ceiling 0.99).
- **correct** — `c' = max(0.05, c · 0.5)` (sharp, recoverable halving).
- **decay** — flat for a 30-day grace window, then a 180-day half-life curve
  on time since `last_seen`. Non-compounding: decay applies the true elapsed
  staleness once and advances `last_seen`, so running it daily never
  double-erodes.

The CLI does the math; `/patterns` decides WHICH instinct to reinforce or
correct based on the observation ledger + the conversation.

## 2. The 100% observe loop

`hooks/observe-tool-calls.py` is a `PreToolUse` hook that fires on **every**
matched tool call and appends one scrubbed JSON line to
`~/.claude/instinct/observations.jsonl`:

```json
{"ts":"2026-05-29T23:40:00Z","session":"a1b2c3d4","project":"repo:my-app","tool":"Bash","action":"bash:git","detail":"git status"}
```

It is built to three hard contracts:

1. **Never blocks** — always emits the neutral passthrough, even on its own
   internal error. A ledger must never degrade a real tool call.
2. **Fast** — no subprocess on the hot path; the project key comes from a cheap
   filesystem walk.
3. **Sensitive-path-safe** — logs the tool + a COARSE action + a short detail,
   never file CONTENT; suppresses detail for secret-bearing paths
   (`.env`, `admin.env`, `*.key`, `.ssh/`, …); runs every captured string
   through a secret scrubber (AWS/GitHub/Stripe/Anthropic/OpenAI/npm patterns +
   `key=`/`token=`/`Bearer` forms).

This is **complementary to** `post-tool-use-learnings.py`, which captures only
failures + explicit `<learning>` annotations as episodic notes. The observe
ledger is the full, scrubbed tool-call stream that `/patterns` reads instead of
re-scanning the transcript.

---

## 3. Project scoping

`project_id` isolates instincts so a repo-specific convention does not bleed
into unrelated work:

- `global` — applies everywhere (the default; all existing memories backfill to this).
- `personal-vault` — the vault's own instincts.
- `repo:<name>` / a remote-url hash — a specific code repo.

A context loader (and `export`) surfaces `project_id == current OR global`, so
project isolation is **opt-in for future instincts** and **never hides**
anything that is currently global.

---

## 4. /evolve — promote a cluster into a structure

When a domain accumulates several high-confidence instincts, `/evolve` proposes
promoting them into ONE structure:

```bash
python3 scripts/instinct.py evolve
```

Clusters instincts by inferred domain; any cluster with **≥ 2 instincts and
median confidence ≥ 0.80** gets a proposed-skill scaffold written to
`⚙️ Meta/Instinct Proposals/`. Promotion to a real Command/Skill/Agent is a
human judgment call — the scaffold is a starting point, not an auto-created skill.

---

## 5. Portable export / import

```bash
python3 scripts/instinct.py export --min-confidence 0.70 --out pack.yaml
python3 scripts/instinct.py import pack.yaml --dry-run   # review
python3 scripts/instinct.py import pack.yaml             # apply
```

The pack unit is one instinct: `id / trigger / confidence / domain /
source_repo` + `action` + `evidence`. Import is **confidence-gated**: a
higher-confidence incoming instinct updates the local one, an equal-or-lower
one is skipped, and a brand-new one lands in `inherited/` (tagged
`inherited: true`, `observations: 0`).

---

## 6. CLI reference

```
python3 scripts/instinct.py backfill [--dry-run] [--no-backup]
python3 scripts/instinct.py reseed   [--dry-run] [--no-backup]
python3 scripts/instinct.py reinforce <slug>
python3 scripts/instinct.py correct   <slug>
python3 scripts/instinct.py decay     [--dry-run]
python3 scripts/instinct.py recompute [--limit N]      # decay + report
python3 scripts/instinct.py report    [--project P] [--min-confidence F] [--stale] [--json] [--limit N]
python3 scripts/instinct.py export    [--project P] [--min-confidence F] [--all] [--out FILE]
python3 scripts/instinct.py import    FILE [--dry-run]
python3 scripts/instinct.py evolve    [--out DIR]
```

Memory dir resolves from `--memory-dir` → `$INSTINCT_MEMORY_DIR` → an upward
walk for `*Meta/Agent Memory` → the default vault path.

## 7. Safety + tests

- Every managed-field write keeps a one-time `<file>.bak-instinct` snapshot.
- Edits are **surgical**: only the four managed keys change; all other
  frontmatter lines and the entire body are byte-preserved.
- Runs are idempotent — a second identical run writes nothing.
- `python3 tests/test_instinct.py` covers the math, surgical editing,
  backfill/correct/reinforce, export/import round-trip, evolve, and project
  scoping. `python3 hooks/observe-tool-calls.py --self-test` covers capture +
  redaction.
