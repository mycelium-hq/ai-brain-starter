# Hook install architecture

Where ai-brain-starter installs its hooks, why, and how to migrate from older installs.

## TL;DR

- **Hooks install at USER level by default** (`~/.claude/settings.json`).
- **Why:** project-level hooks (`<project>/.claude/settings.json`) silently don't fire when Claude Code runs from inside a git worktree (`<project>/.claude/worktrees/<name>/`). User-level hooks fire universally.
- **Closes [#6](https://github.com/mycelium-hq/ai-brain-starter/issues/6).**
- **Idempotent:** re-running the installer detects already-installed hooks via fingerprint and skips them. Custom user hooks are NEVER touched.
- **Reversible:** `--uninstall` removes only ai-brain-starter entries, leaves everything else intact.

## How to install

New install (already runs as part of `bootstrap.sh`):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py
```

Preview without writing:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py --dry-run
```

Install, then verify every referenced script is on disk (this WRITES settings.json):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py --verify
```

Check an existing install without changing it (writes nothing, installs nothing):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py --verify-only
```

Uninstall:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py --uninstall
```

## Migration from project-level installs

If you installed ai-brain-starter before this fix, your hooks live at project level (`<vault>/.claude/settings.json` or `<vault>/.claude/settings.local.json`). They work in the main vault directory but silently fail in worktrees.

### Automatic detection

The `migrate-to-user-level.py` SessionStart hook detects this and prompts you:

> **Heads up: your ai-brain-starter hooks are installed at project level, which means they don't fire when you work inside a git worktree. To migrate to user-level (universal): run `python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py`. This is additive — your existing hooks stay, and there's a backup. Want me to run it now?**

The prompt fires once per vault; if you decline, set `migrationDeclined: true` in your CLAUDE.md frontmatter to silence it.

### Manual migration

Run the installer directly:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py
```

This is **additive**: it adds the hooks to user-level WITHOUT removing them from project-level. Both sets coexist; once you've verified user-level works, you can manually clean up the project-level entries by editing `<vault>/.claude/settings.json`.

### Verifying the fix

Run the worktree firing regression test:
```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/test-hooks-in-worktree.sh
```

Six checks:
1. Hook fires from main worktree (sanity)
2. Hook fires from inside a `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` worktree
3. Worktree name is correctly derived from the path
4. Installer preserves user's custom hooks
5. Installer adds ai-brain-starter hooks
6. Installer is idempotent (second run produces identical file)

All six should pass.

## Architecture details

### What gets installed

The hooks shipped by ai-brain-starter (per [`hooks.json`](../hooks.json) source-of-truth):

| Event | Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `detect-closing-signal.py` | Detects `bye`/`thanks`/`good night`/etc. and pre-resolves session-close cascade context |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `log-skill-usage.py` | Opt-in `/skill` invocation logging for usage analytics |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | (legacy session-context loader) | Auto-loads `Last Session.md` + `Current Priorities.md` on first prompt |
| `Stop` | `session-end-hook.sh` | Aggregators, retention cleanup, git snapshot, Haiku fallback |
| `PreToolUse:Write\|Edit\|MultiEdit` | `lint-vault-frontmatter.py` | Blocks malformed YAML in vault frontmatter at write boundary |
| `SessionStart` | `first-week-checkin.py` | Day 3 / 7 / 14 stewardship prompts |
| `SessionStart` | `migrate-to-user-level.py` | Detects project-level installs and offers migration |
| `PreCompact` | (inline systemMessage) | Reminds the model to preserve context before compaction |

### Opt-in: sibling-session coordination lock

`hooks/session-lock.py` is **not** auto-installed by `hooks.json` — it is opt-in, because it only matters once you run **multiple Claude Code sessions against the same git repo at once** (the "many concurrent sessions on one brain" workflow). When you do, two sessions can clobber each other's in-flight git state — the SIBLING-SESSION-PARALLEL-COMMIT-COLLISION class, where one session commits broken state and reverts, wiping the other's work.

The lock runs in three modes off one shared file (`<repo>/.claude/.session-lock.json`, a multi-session map):

- **SessionStart** — warns (informationally) if another session was active in this repo in the last 5 minutes. It also tells you when the enforcement layer below **cannot fire in this repo at all**: if the git dir lives outside the checkout (a mirror or `--separate-git-dir` layout), no command resolves as "this repo" and nothing is gated. Without that line a dormant gate and a quiet one look identical, and the warning reads like protection you do not have.
- **PreToolUse(Bash)** — the *enforcement* layer. While a sibling is live, a **git-mutating** command (commit / push / checkout / switch / branch-create / merge / rebase / reset / cherry-pick / revert / pull / am / apply) that targets *this* repo is warn-blocked every time (exit 2); any other command warns once, then stays quiet so read-only parallel work isn't nagged. A `cd` into another repo, or an explicit `-C` / `--work-tree` / `--git-dir` pointed elsewhere, is correctly attributed to that other repo and let through (no false-block).

  **One exemption — a provably scoped commit.** `git commit -o <path> [<path>…]` (equivalently `--only`) is **allowed** while a sibling is live, provided it names at least one literal path and the index is empty. `-o` commits the working-tree contents of the paths you name and disregards the index, so it cannot absorb a sibling's staged work — which is the whole harm this gate exists to stop. Without this carve-out the only way to make a safe commit was to disable the gate session-wide, which is how a guard teaches you to turn it off.

  Still blocked, deliberately: a bare `git commit`, `-a`/`--all`, `-i`/`--include`, `--amend` (it takes the staged index even alongside `-o`), `--interactive`, `--patch`, a `.`/glob/magic pathspec (those sweep files you did not name), an unrecognised option (the parse refuses to guess), an explicit `--git-dir`, pathspecs without an explicit `-o`, and a multi-line `-m` message — that last one cannot be tokenised safely, so use `-F <message-file>` instead.
  **Cross-worktree, same-branch — a WARNING, never a block.** Everything above is keyed to the *working tree*, because that is where the catastrophic HEAD/index stomp lives. Two sessions in *different* worktrees are HEAD-isolated and are deliberately never gated against each other — that exemption is what makes the many-concurrent-sessions workflow usable. But it leaves one real gap the moment your branches are named per **ticket** or per **feature** rather than per session: two sessions working the same ticket legitimately share one branch, in two worktrees, and nothing above can see it. Observed in practice — both sessions independently produced the same upstream merge, with the same conflict resolution, and only git's non-fast-forward rejection surfaced it, at push time, after both had done the work.

  So a session now records its branch when it runs a command that touches a shared ref (`push` / `commit` / `merge` / `rebase` / `cherry-pick`), and a live sibling on that same branch in a different directory produces a warning naming it. It is a warning on purpose: a branch is a shared *ref*, not a shared working tree, so no stomp is available and git already refuses the unsafe push. The only recoverable cost is duplicated effort, and the only way to recover that is to be told **before** the work rather than at push time. A branch that cannot be resolved (detached HEAD, not a repo, git unavailable) records nothing and matches nothing, so this fails open by construction.

- **Stop / SessionEnd** — heartbeat + cleanup so the live-session count stays honest.

It never *hard*-blocks: every block is bypassable, only same-repo siblings are ever gated, and different repos worked in parallel never interfere. It pairs with the worktree pattern (which prevents the shared-HEAD collision structurally); the lock covers the case where two sessions still pick the *same* checkout.

To enable it, merge these four entries into `~/.claude/settings.json` (point the path at wherever you keep the hook — e.g. `~/.claude/hooks/session-lock.py`):

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/session-lock.py" } ] }
    ],
    "SessionStart": [
      { "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/session-lock.py 2>/dev/null || echo '{\"continue\":true,\"suppressOutput\":true}'" } ] }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      { "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/session-lock.py 2>/dev/null || echo '{\"continue\":true,\"suppressOutput\":true}'" } ] }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/session-lock.py 2>/dev/null || true" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then gitignore the lock's per-call sidecar files **globally** (they live inside the repos you work in, so a global ignore keeps them out of every repo's status):

```bash
git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.config/git/ignore   # if not already set
cat >> ~/.config/git/ignore <<'EOF'
.claude/.session-lock.json
.claude/.session-lock.lock
.claude/.session-lock.json.tmp.*
EOF
```

Bypass for intentional parallel / collaborative work: set `SIBLING_SESSION_LOCK_BYPASS=1` in the session's environment.

### Fingerprinting

The installer identifies "ai-brain-starter-owned" hooks by substring fingerprint, listed in `install-hooks-user-level.py` under `ABS_FINGERPRINTS`. Anything matching a fingerprint is replaced/updated/uninstalled by this tool. Anything not matching is left strictly alone.

When new hooks ship, the fingerprint list is extended in the same release — old versions of the installer will still work but won't manage the new hook entries until updated.

### Backup + rollback

Every install run that modifies `~/.claude/settings.json` creates a backup at `~/.claude/settings.json.bak-{timestamp}-abs`. The installer verifies the post-write JSON parses; on parse failure, it automatically rolls back to the backup.

To restore manually:
```bash
mv ~/.claude/settings.json.bak-2026-04-30-093900-abs ~/.claude/settings.json
```

### Why not also install at project level?

Project-level hooks have their place — they're the right scope for project-specific behavior. ai-brain-starter's hooks are global (every Claude Code session benefits regardless of which project you're in), so user-level is the correct scope. Installing at both creates duplicate firings.

If you have a specific reason to keep project-level hooks (e.g. you're testing changes locally), the installer doesn't touch them — they remain whatever you set them to.

## Troubleshooting

### "My hooks still don't fire in worktrees"

Verify with the regression test:
```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/test-hooks-in-worktree.sh
```

If tests pass but you still see no hook firing in your real worktree:
- Check `~/.claude/settings.json` actually has the hooks. Run with `--dry-run` to compare.
- Check that no project-level `.claude/settings.json` is overriding (Claude Code merges, with project taking precedence over user-level for the same event/matcher).
- Check the migration hook fired: look for the migration prompt at SessionStart.

### "I want to opt out of one specific hook"

Edit `~/.claude/settings.json` and remove the hook entry. The installer respects manual edits and won't re-add a removed hook unless you run `--uninstall` followed by a fresh install (which would restore everything).

For more granular control, use the per-hook env-var bypasses:
- `VAULT_LINT_BYPASS=1` — disables vault frontmatter linter
- `CLOSING_SIGNAL_DETECTION=off` — disables session-close detector
- `SKILL_USAGE_TELEMETRY=0` — disables skill-usage logger (default off anyway)
- `SIBLING_SESSION_LOCK_BYPASS=1` — disables the opt-in sibling-session coordination lock

### "I want to disable migration prompts"

Add `migrationDeclined: true` to your CLAUDE.md frontmatter. The migration hook will skip silently for that vault.

## Why this matters

Reports of "I said bye and the cascade didn't run" had a quiet root cause: hooks installed at project level don't fire in worktrees, and worktrees are how Claude Code commonly runs feature branches. The session-close cascade ([2026-04-30 changelog entry](CHANGELOG.md)) shipped with the cascade itself fixed at the architecture level, but the *mechanism* that put the hook in front of the model still depended on project-level config.

This drop closes that last gap. Hooks live at user level, fire universally, and there's a verifiable regression test that proves it. New users get user-level installs by default. Existing users get a one-prompt migration path.

This is the second pass through the same problem class — first the cascade, now the hook delivery vehicle. The combined fix is structurally complete: detection (cascade) + delivery (user-level install) + verification (worktree firing test).
