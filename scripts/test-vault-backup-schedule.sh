# Self-test for vault-backup.sh's DAILY SCHEDULE install — the "registered but
# dead" class, on the macOS/Linux side.
#
# What was broken (MYC-3528): install_schedule's Darwin branch ended with
# `[ -f "$plist" ]`, so the function's return value said only "a file exists on
# disk". Both `launchctl bootstrap` and `launchctl load` were swallowed by
# `>/dev/null 2>&1 || true`, so ANY launchd failure was invisible, and cmd_setup
# printed "Daily backup scheduled (03:00 local)." over a job launchd had never
# accepted. The Linux branch had its own instance: an existing crontab line for
# the vault short-circuited to `return 0` on the mere PRESENCE of the vault path,
# so a relocated repo left a line invoking a script that no longer exists — cron
# ran it nightly, it failed nightly, and setup called that live.
#
# `test-vault-backup-roundtrip.sh` passes `--schedule none` in every case, so
# before this file install_schedule had ZERO test coverage on the bash side.
#
# Structure:
#   A. validators, portable  — sourced directly, so the Darwin logic is covered on
#                              the ubuntu CI runner and the Linux logic on a Mac.
#   B. end-to-end, per host  — the real `setup --schedule daily` CLI with launchctl
#                              / crontab STUBBED on PATH, so the honesty of the
#                              reporting is provable without mutating the real
#                              user's launchd or crontab.
#
# The discriminating pair in B is: identical filesystem state (the job file IS
# written), opposite verdicts, decided only by what the scheduler says. That is
# the exact assertion the old `[ -f "$plist" ]` could never make.

# A test that runs to the end having asserted almost nothing is a false green -
# the class MYC-2922 closes. A `legs` counter cannot catch that (every branch of
# the platform switch, including the unsupported one, increments it), so assert a
# floor on the assertions that actually executed.
#
# Measured: section A = 19 on both platforms; section B = 19 on Darwin, 13 on
# Linux, so the totals are 38 and 32. The floor has to sit ABOVE the largest
# single section (19) to catch the other one vanishing, and far enough BELOW the
# smaller total (32) that trimming an assertion or two cannot false-trip it - an
# over-strict gate just teaches people to bypass it. 24 satisfies both: A alone
# (19) and B alone (13 or 19) each trip it, with 8 to spare on Linux.
#
# RE-MEASURE THIS when adding or removing assertions. It was 18 against A=16
# until the shell escaper was replaced by plistlib and section A grew to 19 - at
# which point 18 no longer caught a skipped section B on Linux, and the guard
# would have gone quietly useless while still reading like it worked.
