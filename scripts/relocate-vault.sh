#!/usr/bin/env bash
# relocate-vault.sh — move a vault OUT of a consumer cloud-sync folder onto a
# local disk, leave a symlink so existing references keep resolving, AND migrate
# Claude Code's path-keyed state (session transcripts + the agent-memory symlink)
# so prior session history survives the move.
#
# WHY
# ---
# A git-backed Obsidian/AI-brain vault inside iCloud Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox /
# Google Drive / Box melts the OS sync daemon — the high-churn .git/ + per-session
# worktree checkouts generate millions of file events. The supported fix (Shape A
# in docs/CLOUD_SYNC.md) is to move the vault onto a local disk and leave a
# symlink. A RAW `mv` does the move but SILENTLY ORPHANS Claude Code history:
# Claude stores per-project state under <config>/projects/<key>, where <key> is
# the absolute cwd with every non-alphanumeric character replaced by '-'. Moving
# the vault changes the key, so every prior transcript reads "Session history
# unavailable ... no longer on disk" and the agent-memory symlink dangles. This
# helper does the move AND re-homes that state (copy, never move — old keys stay
# as a backup), so reopening Claude Code in the relocated vault shows the history.
#
# Pure bash + python3 (only for the key transform, to match Claude Code's
# char-wise semantics exactly). No third-party deps.
#
# Usage:
#   relocate-vault.sh <old-vault-path> <new-vault-path> [options]
#   relocate-vault.sh --migrate-claude-state <old-abs-path> <new-abs-path>
#     (state-only: the vault is already at the new path; just fix Claude history)
#   relocate-vault.sh --sweep <old-path> [<new-path>]
#     (report residual references to the old path — classified executed /
#      doc-pointer / keep — with a go/no-go on retiring the symlink)
#   relocate-vault.sh --drop-symlink <old-path> [<new-path>]
#     (retire the old-path symlink, but ONLY when the sweep finds zero executed
#      references; otherwise it refuses and lists what still points at the old path)
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run            print intended actions, change nothing
#   --no-symlink         do NOT leave a symlink at the old path (default leaves one)
#   --force              skip the soft gates (Obsidian-running, active-session,
#                        backup-first). target-exists and source-already-a-symlink
#                        stay FATAL.
#   --ensure-backup      if there is no surviving off-machine backup, STAND ONE UP
#                        (vault-backup.sh setup + verify) BEFORE moving, then proceed
#                        — so a non-technical user reaches a backed-up, relocated
#                        vault in ONE step, without knowing --force or running
#                        vault-backup.sh by hand. Fail-closed: if the stand-up does
#                        not verify, the move is REFUSED (vault untouched). This is
#                        what the SessionStart cloud-sync offer runs.
#   --backup-dest <dir>  where --ensure-backup writes the backup archive (default:
#                        <parent-of-vault>/ai-brain-backups — one file that survives
#                        the move; for a cloud vault that sibling is off-machine).
#   --backup-schedule <daily|none>
#                        schedule the stood-up backup installs (default: daily).
#   --config-dir <dir>   Claude Code config dir (default: $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.claude)
#   -h, --help           this help
#
# --sweep / --drop-symlink shell out to scripts/relocate-sweep.py (same dir).
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok / no-op / GO · 1 refused (gate) / NO-GO · 2 usage · 4 partial failure
