# exit-contract: ENFORCING

# vault-daily-maintenance.sh - heavy vault maintenance, kept OFF the interactive
# session-close path.
#
# Two jobs:
#   1. RECONCILE (data safety): re-run the aggregators and commit any session /
#      decision / captures files a session-close left uncommitted. The close
#      hook (session-end-hook.sh) DEFERS its git snapshot when the machine is
#      saturated or a sibling close holds the cascade mutex; this is the catch-up
#      that snapshots that work within a day so nothing is lost.
#   2. HEAVY HYGIENE (best effort): the full-tree / git-log-walking scripts the
#      substrate ships but that are too heavy to run at every close -
#      drift-detection, check-rule-conflicts --scan-all, passive-capture. They
#      run here once a day, resource-gated, serialized, and at low IO/CPU
#      priority (see templates/launchd/com.abs.vault-daily-maintenance.plist).
#
# Resource-aware: shares the load gate + close-cascade mutex with the close hook
# via _session_close_guard.sh. If 1-min loadavg/core >= CLOSE_MAX_LOAD_PER_CORE
# (default 3.0) it skips the heavy work and logs "deferred - high load"; the next
# daily run (or a --force run) catches up. Serialized on the same mutex the close
# hook uses, so a heavy daily pass never overlaps a live close cascade.
#
# Usage:
#   vault-daily-maintenance.sh --vault-root /path/to/vault          # load-gated
#   VAULT_ROOT=/path/to/vault vault-daily-maintenance.sh            # env form
#   vault-daily-maintenance.sh --vault-root /path --force           # ignore load gate
#   vault-daily-maintenance.sh --vault-root /path --reconcile-only  # skip heavy hygiene
#
# Exit codes: 0 = ran (or cleanly deferred); 1 only on its own setup error
# (missing vault root). Individual maintenance steps never abort the run.

# cannot fail cannot tell you its steps are failing (MYC-4116).
#
# Steps still never ABORT the pass -- that part was right, and is why the

# CRITICAL_STEPS -- the ONLY labels whose non-zero exit is a real failure.
#
# A blanket "any non-zero step" rule is WRONG here, and was briefly shipped as
# one (b27fd6e, corrected in this change). Most legs of this pass are SURFACERS
# that use the exit code as a findings count, so they exit non-zero while
# perfectly healthy: aggregate-sessions and aggregate-decisions report pending
# outcomes, relocate-watch reports residuals, close-phase-contract and
# check-rule-conflicts report findings -- the last only since it was fixed to
# carry a verdict at all. Alarming on those is several false reds a day, and a
# daily red is background inside a week, which is the exact bug class this
# accounting exists to fix.
#
# So the alarm is an explicit must-be-green ALLOWLIST, never a blanket rule.
# Empty here on purpose: no leg in the substrate's own pass is unambiguously
# must-be-green today. Add a label only when its non-zero means BROKEN rather
# than FOUND-SOMETHING -- a security control's negative control is the
# archetype (MYC-4116 seeds the personal vault's copy with pii-scrub-control
# and pii-scrub-hugeline).
