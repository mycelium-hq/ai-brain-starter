"""hook_runner.py — portable failure-masking wrapper for Claude Code hooks.

WHY THIS EXISTS: hooks.json masks hook failures with POSIX shell forms like

    python3 <script> 2>/dev/null || echo '{"continue":true,"suppressOutput":true}'
    [ -f <script> ] && python3 <script> || true

On native Windows, Claude Code executes hook commands under PowerShell 5.1,
PowerShell 7, cmd.exe, or Git Bash depending on version and configuration —
and NO single shell one-liner parses in all four (`||` is a parse error in
PowerShell 5.1, `[ -f ]` and `/dev/null` are POSIX-only, a quoted first token
is a string literal in PowerShell). The result before this wrapper existed:
every hook errored visibly on every prompt for Windows users.

The only command shape all four shells parse identically is a bare PATH
command followed by quoted arguments. So on Windows the installer
(install-hooks-user-level.py) wires every hook as:

    <interpreter> -X utf8 "<abs>/scripts/hook_runner.py" --fallback silent "<abs>/hooks/<hook>.py"

(`-X utf8` is PEP 540 UTF-8 Mode: the hook now runs IN this interpreter, so a
PYTHONUTF8 in a child env has nothing to act on. Without it a hook doing
`open(path).read()` on a UTF-8 file decodes with the console code page and
raises UnicodeDecodeError on the unmapped cp1252 bytes — and UnicodeDecodeError
is a ValueError, so it slips past the `except OSError` in a dozen shipped hooks
and gets masked to "continue". Carried forward from PR #446.)

and this wrapper reproduces the POSIX masking semantics in Python:

  - target script missing        -> print fallback JSON, exit 0 (the [ -f ] guard)
  - target exits 0               -> forward its stdout verbatim, exit 0
  - target exits 2 (a BLOCK)     -> forward stderr, exit 2 (blocking semantics
                                    preserved — exit 2 is Claude Code's
                                    intentional block signal, never masked)
  - target exits anything else,
    crashes, or can't launch     -> print fallback JSON, exit 0 (the 2>/dev/null
                                    + || echo masking)
  - target HANGS                 -> after ABS_HOOK_TIMEOUT seconds (45 by
                                    default) the fallback JSON is emitted and
                                    the process hard-exits 0. See "A HANG IS
                                    BOUNDED" below.

Fallback forms (--fallback):
  silent  {"continue": true, "suppressOutput": true}          (default)
  allow   {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
           "permissionDecision": "allow"}}   — for PreToolUse guards that must
           fail open rather than wedge every tool call.

stdin (the hook payload JSON) is passed through to the target unchanged.
Stdlib-only; usable on macOS/Linux too, though POSIX installs keep their
original shell forms to avoid churning working configs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
INTERPRETER-COUNT CONTRACT: ONE PYTHON PROCESS PER HOOK. NEVER TWO. (MYC-3877)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This wrapper USED TO run the hook with

    subprocess.run([sys.executable, script, *extra], ...)

which made the chain per hook  shell -> launcher -> interpreter #1 (this file)
-> interpreter #2 (the hook).  A second CPython startup costs ~92 ms on a
2019-class Windows laptop with live AV, measured on every single tool call
(PreToolUse alone ran ~1.6 s of pure hook latency). The wrapper's own work is
microseconds; the process was the entire bill.

The hook is now COMPILED AND EXECUTED IN THIS PROCESS (_execute below), as
`__main__`, so `if __name__ == "__main__":` still fires and argv/stdin/sys.path
look exactly like `python <script>`. The observable contract above is
unchanged — same exit codes, same two streams, same masking.

DO NOT REINTRODUCE A CHILD INTERPRETER. scripts/test_hook_runner_single_interpreter.py
fails on any `subprocess`/`os.exec*`/`os.spawn*`/`sys.executable` reference in
this file AND asserts behaviorally that the hook reports THIS process's pid.

Why in-process and not exec-replace (os.execv): exec throws this file's code
away, so a hook that exits 1 or crashes could no longer be masked — and masking
is the entire reason this wrapper exists. Exec drops the interpreter count to
one but drops the contract with it.

HOW ISOLATION IS PRESERVED WITHOUT A PROCESS BOUNDARY. This process runs exactly
ONE hook and then exits, so "corrupting a later hook" is not reachable; what has
to hold is that the RUNNER still reports the right thing after a hostile hook.

  * unhandled exception  -> caught, traceback goes to the CAPTURED stderr
                            (discarded by the mask, exactly as before), exit 1
                            -> masked.
  * sys.exit(N)          -> SystemExit caught, N routed through the same
                            protocol. A non-int argument prints and exits 1,
                            matching CPython.
  * os._exit(N)          -> os._exit is swapped for a guard that raises
                            SystemExit instead, so a hard exit is masked like
                            any other. The guard is PID-scoped: inside a fork
                            or a multiprocessing child it calls the real
                            os._exit, so nothing about child-process teardown
                            changes.
  * a FORK whose child   -> that child falls out of exec() and would otherwise
    does NOT hard-exit      re-run the whole reporting path, emitting the
                            capture a SECOND time: two concatenated JSON
                            documents, which Claude Code cannot parse. The
                            finally in _execute hard-exits any process that is
                            not the owner before a single byte is reported.
  * stdout / stderr      -> captured at the FILE-DESCRIPTOR level (dup2 onto two
                            temp files), which is what subprocess's
                            capture_output did: output written by a grandchild
                            that inherited fd 1, or by a raw os.write(1, ...),
                            is captured too. The captured BYTES are forwarded
                            unchanged, so no locale decode sits in the path
                            (that was the cp1252 crash class of #313).
  * DESCRIPTOR HYGIENE   -> subprocess passed close_fds=True, so the old hook
                            saw exactly [0,1,2]. In-process there is no such
                            boundary, and the two capture files plus the two
                            saved stdio dups landed on fds 3-6 — precisely the
                            range `os.close(3)` and every daemonize recipe
                            clears. A hook doing that made the restore raise and
                            the verdict VANISH (measured: the pre-fix runner
                            emitted {"continue":true}, this one emitted nothing
                            at all). Every descriptor this file owns is now
                            parked above _HIGH_FD_BASE and marked
                            non-inheritable, a capture the hook closed is
                            re-acquired from the live stdio fd, and no single
                            restore step can raise.
  * cwd, sys.path, sys.argv, os.environ, sys.stdin/stdout/stderr, signal
    handlers, sys.modules["__main__"]
                         -> snapshotted before and restored in a finally, each
                            step INDIVIDUALLY tolerant of failure: a raise
                            anywhere in the restore used to escape _execute and
                            replace a real verdict with the fallback (measured
                            on a hook that swaps sys.modules["signal"]). The
                            reporting path in main() is wrapped for the same
                            reason — a raise there produced exit 1 plus a
                            visible traceback, exactly the class this file
                            exists to prevent.
  * teardown noise       -> main() ends in os._exit, so an atexit handler or a
                            thread waking after the verdict cannot append bytes
                            to it. All the runner's own output goes out through
                            unbuffered os.write, so nothing is lost by skipping
                            interpreter shutdown.

A HANG IS BOUNDED, AND THE RUNNER STAYS KILLABLE.
  * BOUNDED: a watchdog thread emits the fallback JSON and hard-exits 0 after
    ABS_HOOK_TIMEOUT seconds (default 45, set to 0 to disable). This replaces
    the `subprocess.run(..., timeout=45)` the child-process shape carried; the
    installer additionally writes `"timeout": 45` on every Windows hook entry so
    Claude Code bounds it from the outside too.
  * KILLABLE: the hook IS this process, so a hook that installs ANY SIGTERM
    handler — an ordinary non-exiting cleanup handler, not just a hostile
    SIG_IGN — made the runner survive its own SIGTERM (measured: the pre-fix
    runner died 0.0 s after terminate(), this one was still alive 6 s later).
    signal.signal is therefore shimmed for the hook's window: a handler the hook
    installs for a fatal signal still runs, and then the process dies the way an
    unhandled signal would have. Restored the moment the hook returns.

KNOWN, ACCEPTED DIVERGENCES (all narrower than the bug they replace):
  * A hard crash of the interpreter itself (segfault via ctypes, os.abort) now
    takes the runner down instead of being masked. No stdlib-Python hook can
    reach that state.
  * A hook that closes EVERY descriptor in its own process without forking
    (os.closerange(3, RLIMIT_NOFILE)) destroys the runner's only handle on the
    real stdout, and its verdict cannot be reported. Parking our descriptors
    high covers the idioms that appear in practice (os.close(3), closerange over
    a small range); the daemonize recipe that closes everything forks first, and
    the fork guard above hard-exits that child untouched.
  * A hook that reaches past the shim — `import _signal` and calling its signal
    directly — can still make the runner ignore SIGTERM for the hook's window,
    and a hook that calls signal.alarm/setitimer itself disarms the watchdog.
    Nothing in this repo does either; the `"timeout"` the installer writes on
    every Windows entry is the outer bound that still applies in both cases,
    which is why it exists on top of the watchdog rather than instead of it.
  * sys.stdin is replaced with the payload; a hook reading raw fd 0 (nothing in
    this repo does) sees the already-drained descriptor.
