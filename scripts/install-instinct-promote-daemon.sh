# exit-contract: NOT-A-CHECKER -- installs a launchd plist; a one-shot
#   installer

# install-instinct-promote-daemon.sh
#
# One-shot installer for the Instinct Engine's daily promotion pass (macOS).
#
# The engine's confidence update is bidirectional but MANUAL -- it only moves
# when a human runs /patterns and invokes `reinforce`/`correct`. Left to that,
# it does not run, and every stored confidence stays the seed it was born with
# while the observation ledger fills with evidence nothing reads. This installs
# the scheduled half.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/install-instinct-promote-daemon.sh /abs/path/to/vault
#
# Idempotent: re-running unloads the old plist before writing the new one.
# Requires: macOS, launchctl, /usr/bin/python3.
