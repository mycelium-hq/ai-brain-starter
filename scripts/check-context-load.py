"""check-context-load.py — MYC-630: automated first-run context-load self-test.

Phase 19's "ask me what you know about me" test relies on the user launching
Claude from the *right* working directory. Claude Code loads a vault's CLAUDE.md
by walking UP from the launch cwd to the filesystem root — so a vault launched
from the wrong folder loads only the global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, answers
generically, and the user concludes "this doesn't work" and churns. Nothing
in the install actually proved the personalized context would load.

This script is that proof. It does NOT just re-check that context files exist
(diagnose.sh and context-audit.py already do existence). It simulates Claude
Code's CLAUDE.md ancestor-walk and answers one deterministic question:

    "If Claude is launched from <launch-dir>, will the vault's personalized
     context load on the first run?"

It also emits the exact `cd "<vault>" && claude` command, so the install can
tell the user precisely where to launch instead of a vague "your vault folder."

Verdicts (--porcelain prints the single most-severe token):
  OK_WILL_LOAD               personalized CLAUDE.md will load from launch-dir
  FAIL_NO_CLAUDE_MD          no CLAUDE.md at the vault root
  FAIL_TEMPLATE_UNFILLED:<d> CLAUDE.md is the unfilled template or a stub
                             (d = "stub" or the placeholder count)
  FAIL_WRONG_CWD:<dir>       launch-dir is not inside the vault, so the vault
                             CLAUDE.md is NOT on the cwd->root path (won't load)
  WARN_MISSING_CONTEXT:<n>   CLAUDE.md references session-start files that are
                             absent (loads, but the first answer will be thin)

Exit codes (match diagnose.sh): 0 = will load, 1 = will NOT load (a FAIL_*
verdict — the install gate should not declare "done"), 2 = loads with warnings.

Usage:
  python3 check-context-load.py [VAULT] [--launch-dir DIR] [--porcelain|--json]

VAULT defaults to $VAULT_PATH or the current directory. --launch-dir defaults to
VAULT (the recommended launch dir); pass the live session cwd to catch a vault
that is being run from the wrong folder right now.
