"""sync-skills.py — propagate skill updates from the ai-brain-starter repo
into the user's installed ~/.claude/skills/ directory.

Cross-platform (macOS / Linux / Windows) successor to sync-skills.sh, which is
now a thin delegator to this file. The bash version could not run on native
Windows, so Windows installs never received skill-content updates after a pull.

Runs after `git pull` on the starter repo. For each skill bundled under
skills/, syncs every file into the corresponding installed skill folder. Never
destroys user customizations without recovery: any installed file that differs
from the incoming repo file is backed up to <file>.bak-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM before
being overwritten.

Honors the NEVER-fail-silently rule: writes a structured summary to the
starter repo's .sync.log and prints it to stdout so the session-start hook can
surface it to Claude (who surfaces it to the user).

Skip guards (all preserved from the shell version):
  - Installed skill dir is a symlink        -> managed elsewhere, skip.
  - Installed skill dir has its own .git    -> independently managed fork, skip.
  - Destination file (or a parent dir) is a symlink -> maintainer workflow, skip.

Env overrides for hermetic tests: ABS_SYNC_STARTER_DIR, ABS_SYNC_INSTALL_DIR.

Usage: python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/sync-skills.py
Exit:  0 clean, 2 if any file operation errored (so the hook can surface it).

# Drift DETECTION (MYC-3076) — the read-only twin of the sync above.
#
# sync-skills.py propagates skill content ONLY when the auto-update actually
# moves the clone's HEAD (ai-brain-auto-update.py runs it inside the
# `head != origin` branch). Once the clone reaches origin/main by any path, sync
# never re-fires, so the clone can sit AHEAD of the bare `~/.claude/skills/<name>`
# copies that actually serve a skill — with zero signal. That is
# LIVE-SKILL-COPY-DRIFT (the sequel to MYC-720's clone drift, one level up):
# the 2026-07-14 daily-journal + insights movement mechanics reached the clone
# but not the copies serving /journal + /weekly.
#
# classify_drift() reports it, DIRECTIONALLY: it names sections the clone has
# that a bare copy LACKS (upstream-ahead) and never flags a copy that only LEADS
# upstream (a local edit later upstreamed — e.g. the array-floor form), so the
# surface can never nag a user to overwrite their own newer work. It reuses the
# EXACT skip guards the sync uses (symlink / .git-fork), so what it reports is
# exactly what a sync would touch — one source of truth.
