#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# scripts/ci.sh - the canonical, locally-runnable unit/type gate for
# ai-brain-starter. ONE command, shared by two callers so they can never drift:
#
#   1. .github/workflows/lint.yml  - the `ci` job runs `bash scripts/ci.sh`.
#   2. ~/.local/bin/ci-test        - resolves this repo to mode=canon and runs
#                                    the same `bash scripts/ci.sh` pre-push.
#
# It runs EXACTLY the unit/type gate that lint.yml used to run as separate jobs:
#   (a) Python syntax     - py_compile every tracked *.py. Catches the PEP 604
#                           `X | None` annotation class that crashes Python 3.9
#                           at module load (many users invoke hooks via macOS's
#                           system /usr/bin/python3, which is 3.9).
#   (b) Shell integration - the named tests under tests/integration/, in
#                           order, stopping at the first failure.
#   (c) Shell static analysis - scripts/shellcheck.sh, the SAME script lint.yml's
#                           dedicated `shellcheck` job runs, so the local pre-push
#                           gate and CI cannot drift on shell quality. Skipped here
#                           when running inside GitHub Actions (the dedicated job
#                           already covers it); locally it is warn-and-skipped
#                           when the shellcheck binary is absent (CI enforces it).
#   (d) Phase-doc Python  - scripts/check-phase-python.py extracts every Python
#                           block from phases/*.md and runs the undefined-name
#                           check (ruff F821). Catches a bare-identifier typo in
#                           an install heredoc - a runtime NameError that (a)'s
#                           py_compile cannot see (it lints tracked *.py only, and
#                           py_compile does not catch undefined names). A dedicated
#                           lint.yml job enforces this in CI (as the shellcheck job
#                           does); here it is best-effort, skipped without a linter.
#   (e) UTF-8 console guard - scripts/check-utf8-stdout.py fails a runnable vault
#                           CLI that print()s non-ASCII (the "gear Meta" emoji, an
#                           em dash, an accented name) without reconfiguring
#                           stdout/stderr to UTF-8. On a Windows cp1252 console
#                           that print() raises UnicodeEncodeError and the caller
#                           reads the empty output as failure (ai-brain-starter#313).
#                           A dedicated lint.yml 'utf8-console-guard' job is
#                           authoritative in CI; here it runs locally (pure stdlib).
#   (f) Python unit tests - the scripts/test_*.py stdlib suites (the claude-router
#                           structured-envelope gate, the graph-liveness
#                           STAMP-GREEN-WHILE-GONE guard). Gate (a) py_compiles them,
#                           which proves they PARSE but never that their asserts RUN;
#                           a suite that compiles but never executes is a false green
#                           (revert the code it guards and the gate stays green -
#                           MYC-2922). scripts/test_*.py runs as a GLOB (a new one can
#                           never go dormant); hooks/test_*.py + tests/test_*.py are
#                           guarded by a coverage invariant so a new one must be wired
#                           to run (wrapper or direct) or the gate fails (MYC-2959).
#                           Unlike (c)/(d)/(e) it has no dedicated CI job, so it runs
#                           in BOTH CI and the local pre-push gate (like (a) and (b)).
#
# It does NOT run the OTHER pure-lint jobs (bash -n, pwsh ParseFile, BOM, em-dash,
# JSON, privacy, references, no-remote-pipe-install). Those stay as their own
# lint.yml jobs - they are lint, not the unit/type gate. Two are exceptions,
# enforced pre-push because they are cross-platform CORRECTNESS gates, not style:
# the shell static-analysis gate (the GNU-vs-BSD `stat` mtime class) and the UTF-8
# console guard (the Windows cp1252 print-crash class).
#
# Environment the integration tests need (lint.yml provides these in the `ci`
# job; this script adds a non-invasive fallback so a fresh `bash scripts/ci.sh`
# works for a contributor too):
#   - A git identity. The tests create temp repos and commit; they set their own
#     LOCAL identity, but a fresh box may have no ambient identity at all, so we
#     export GIT_* defaults only when nothing is configured.
#   - ruff on PATH is OPTIONAL: test_session_coordination_guards exercises the
#     F821 block path when ruff is present and fails OPEN (still green) when not.
#   - Python 3.9 for the py_compile check is IDEAL (it is the version whose crash
#     class this gate exists to catch). We prefer `python3.9` when present and
#     fall back to `python3` otherwise. lint.yml pins 3.9 via setup-python, so
#     CI is always authoritative for the 3.9 check; the local fallback to a newer
#     interpreter is a weaker superset check (it will not catch 3.9-only crashes).
