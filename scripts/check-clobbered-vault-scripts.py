"""Detect vault scripts broken or silently reverted by a sync.

`sync-vault-scripts.sh` propagates the repo's `scripts/` into a vault's
`<meta>/scripts/`, overwriting whatever is there and keeping a `.bak-<stamp>`
nobody reads. Two failure modes follow, both silent:

  BROKEN-DEP  a synced script sources/imports a sibling that is NOT beside it.
              Consumers ship without their dependency and fall back to a stub.
              Measured: `vault-safe-commit.sh` fell to a fail-closed stub and
              EVERY vault commit refused (it is the only route past the raw-git
              block guard), while `session-end-hook.sh` fell to "defer" and
              silently no-opped every session-end snapshot for two days.
              Prevention now lives in test_vault_script_sync.sh section 1b; this
              is the AT-REST leg for vaults synced before that gate existed.

  REVERTED    a vault script is byte-identical to the repo copy AND differs from
              the vault's own git HEAD. That means a local patch was overwritten
              by the sync. Measured: a committed `--only` scoping fix was reverted
              ~14h after it landed, because it had not been upstreamed yet, and
              nothing said so. Closure gates cannot see this one — the file is
              present and its dependencies resolve; it is simply the wrong version.

Surfacer only: prints findings, never mutates, never auto-restores. Restoring is
the operator's call because the local version is not always the one you want.

Exit: 0 clean (or --surface), 1 findings, 2 could not run.

Usage:
  python3 check-clobbered-vault-scripts.py --vault /path/to/vault
  python3 check-clobbered-vault-scripts.py --vault ... --surface   # always exit 0
