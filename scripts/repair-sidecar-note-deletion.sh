# repair-sidecar-note-deletion.sh — find notes an OLD machinery-relocation
# deleted from a vault's history, and put them back.
#
# WHO THIS IS FOR
# ---------------
# An earlier version of scripts/relocate-machinery-sidecar.sh treated
# "⚙️ Meta/Sessions" as a cache because of its NAME. In a real vault that folder
# holds notes, and git tracks them. Relocating it turned the folder into a
# symlink, `git status` reported every note as deleted, the hourly auto-snapshot
# (`git add -A`) COMMITTED that deletion, and the multi-machine sync PUSHED it.
# The whole time, the message on screen said "nothing was deleted".
#
# The current script can no longer do this — it tests the git index before it
# moves anything, and `--rollback` puts the folder back. But rollback only fixes
# the FOLDER. It does not fix the HISTORY, and it cannot reach the other
# computers that already pulled the deletion. That is what this script is for.
#
# WHAT IT LOOKS FOR (the exact fingerprint, not a guess)
# ------------------------------------------------------
# A folder is reported ONLY when BOTH of these are true:
#   1. git history contains a commit that DELETED tracked files under that path
#      (an ordinary note deletion by hand looks the same on this half alone), AND
#   2. that same path is a SYMLINK pointing outside the vault, or that very
#      commit recorded the path ITSELF as a symlink.
# Nothing a person does by hand produces (2). A folder replaced by a link to
# somewhere else, in the same commit that removed everything inside it, is a
# machine doing it — this one.
#
# Condition (2) is also what makes this work on a SECOND computer, which never
# ran the relocation and has no sidecar at all: it pulled the commit, so it has
# the dangling link and the same deletion.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH: a vault where the deletion was committed but the link
# was never committed AND has since been removed. Nothing durable is left to
# distinguish that from a person deleting a folder on purpose, so this refuses
# to guess. `git log -- "<folder>"` shows it by hand.
#
# WHAT --repair DOES
#   · takes the link out of the way (never overwrites anything real)
#   · if the notes are still on this machine in the sidecar, moves them back —
#     these are the LIVE copies, so they win over the older ones in history
#   · anything still missing is restored from the commit BEFORE the deletion
#   · saves that as one ordinary commit, touching only the damaged folder
#   · never pushes. The next sync carries the repair to the other computers.
#
# It never deletes note content, never force-anythings, and refuses rather than
# overwrite whenever both a real folder and a saved copy exist.
#
# Pure bash + git + python3 (path handling only). No third-party deps.
#
# Usage:
#   repair-sidecar-note-deletion.sh <vault-path>              # look only, change nothing
#   repair-sidecar-note-deletion.sh <vault-path> --repair     # put the notes back
#
# Options:
#   --sidecar <dir>   sidecar root to consult for recorded moves
#                     (default: $BRAIN_SIDECAR or ~/.brain-sidecar)
#   --repair          perform the repair (default is look-only)
#   --quiet           only print the verdict line
#   -h, --help        this help
#
# Exit codes: 0 nothing wrong / repaired · 1 could not check, or a repair leg
#             failed · 2 usage · 10 damage found (look-only mode)
