"""Validate a session-close rule file against the close cascade's phase contract.

`hooks/detect-closing-signal.py` injects a numbered cascade into the model's
context at close. A rule file describes the same process for the same reader.
When the two disagree about what a NUMBER means, the number is worse than no
number at all — and the failure is silent, because each file is internally
consistent.

That is not hypothetical. ai-brain-starter#400 added a `/goal clear` reminder to
the shipped rule and labelled it "Phase 4b" using the cascade's numbering; under
the rule's own numbering Phase 4 was the step that happens automatically with no
involvement from the reader, so the label announced that the goal clears itself.
#415 aligned the shipped rule. Then the SAME defect turned up in an installed,
heavily customised copy of that rule: it carried a "Phase 4b" with no Phase 4
anywhere in the file. A guard that only ever ran against the file in this repo
could not see it.

So this checker takes a PATH. The shipped template is the default; `--rule`
points it at an installed copy, which is where rules actually drift.

Two tiers, deliberately:

  STRUCTURAL (always on, no false positives possible)
    - no duplicate phase numbers          a number must head exactly one section
    - no orphan sub-phase                 "4b" requires a "4" to belong to
    These are properties of the file alone. An installed rule may legitimately
    rename, reorder, add and drop phases; it may never define 4b without 4.

  MEANING (--strict-meaning, canonical files only)
    - a number present in BOTH the rule and the cascade must denote the same step
    Enforced on the file this repo ships. NOT enforced by default, because an
    installed rule is customised prose ("Summary format" for "Final summary") and
    a checker that fails on legitimate customisation teaches people to bypass it,
    which then hides the structural failures that matter.

Exit 0 = pass. Exit 1 = contract violated. Exit 2 = could not check (fail loud;
a checker that cannot read its inputs must never report success).

Pure stdlib. Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-close-phase-contract.py                    # shipped template
    python3 scripts/check-close-phase-contract.py --strict-meaning   # + meaning pins
    python3 scripts/check-close-phase-contract.py --rule ~/vault/rules/session-close.md
