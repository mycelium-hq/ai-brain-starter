"""Validate that the install phase files form one complete, walkable chain.

The install is 12 files under `phases/`, ~3,700 lines, covering phases 0-24.
Until this guard shipped, the ONLY thing sequencing them was the Phase Routing
Table in SKILL.md. Ten of the twelve files contained no reference to any other
phase file anywhere in their body: each one simply ended.

That is a silent failure. A model reads SKILL.md, starts executing, and by the
time it finishes `phase-02-03-plugins-folders.md` it has consumed ~68 KB of
phase content plus the user's interview answers. The routing table is no longer
steering. The file ends, and the model reports the install complete. The user is
left with folders and a skeleton CLAUDE.md, and the phases that build the
context layer, the journal, the panel and the insights never run. Nothing
errors. Nothing is missing from disk. It just stops.

Observed in the wild 2026-08-15: an install stopped dead at the
phase-02-03 -> phase-04 file boundary and reported itself finished. The user's
own CLAUDE.md recorded "phases completed: folder structure (Phase 3) + profile
(Phase 3b)" while 15 phases had never run.

So every phase file now carries a footer that names its successor, and this
checker holds that footer to a contract. The footer is BOTH:

  - model-facing prose  (`phases/<next>.md` referenced in the text) so the model
    executing the install actually knows where to go, and
  - a machine marker    (`<!-- phase-chain: next=<file> -->`) so this checker can
    verify the chain without parsing prose.

Both halves are required. A marker with no prose is a green checker over an
install that still stops; prose with no marker is an unverifiable chain. The
pair is the contract.

Checks (all structural — no false positives possible, no judgement calls):

  1. Every `phases/phase-*.md` carries exactly one phase-chain marker.
  2. Exactly one file is marked `terminal`.
  3. Every `next=` target names a file that EXISTS in phases/.
  4. Non-terminal files also reference `phases/<target>` in their prose, so the
     machine marker and the model-facing instruction cannot drift apart.
  5. Exactly one head (a file nothing else points to).
  6. Walking from the head reaches EVERY phase file exactly once — no orphan, no
     cycle, no fork.

Check 6 is the one that catches the real regression: someone adds
`phase-25-whatever.md`, wires nothing to it, and it never runs for anybody.

Exit 0 = chain intact. Exit 1 = contract violated. Exit 2 = could not check
(fail loud; a checker that cannot read its inputs must never report success).

Pure stdlib. Usage:
