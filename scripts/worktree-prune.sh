# Weekly git worktree maintenance for the vault. Self-locates so it survives a move.
#
# Worktree pileup is prevented at the SOURCE by the lifecycle hooks
# (remove-ended-worktree at SessionEnd, enforce-worktree-cap at SessionStart,
# worktree-footprint-signal at SessionStart). This weekly job is the BACKSTOP +
# the orphan/branch/snapshot sweep:
#   1. Safe reclaim of scratch worktrees over cap + ORPHAN DIRS via
#      worktree-reclaim.py — snapshot-then-remove. NEVER the unsafe `rm -rf` an
#      earlier version did: genuinely-unsaved files are copied out first, and a
#      dir we can't reason about (dangling git metadata) is KEPT and reported.
#   2. `git worktree prune` for stale refs.
#   3. Delete orphan claude/ BRANCHES whose worktree is gone AND merged to master
#      (REFUSE + recover-script pointer for any with unmerged commits — the
#      worktree session-loss class from issue #65).
#   4. Prune orphan SNAPSHOT dirs past the recovery-retention window.
#
# Only `.claude/worktrees/` scratch + their orphan dirs are auto-removed.
# Deliberate ~/dev/<repo>-<slug> sibling worktrees and committed branches are
# never removed. Each block silently no-ops when its tool/dir is absent, so this
# is safe to ship before the matching hooks land.
