"""Guard: refuse to treat a path as an AI-brain vault when it is $HOME, a
filesystem root, or not a vault at all.

The relocate helpers take a `<vault-path>` argument and, when that path has no
`.git`, CREATE a repository there (`git init --separate-git-dir`). Before this
guard the only validation was "non-empty" and "is a directory", so pointing a
helper at `$HOME` turned the user's whole home directory into a git working
tree — with `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.netrc` and `~/.config/gh` sitting untracked
inside it and one `git add -A` away from being written into git objects
permanently. Observed on a real machine, not theoretical (MYC-4028).

This is the single source of truth for that check IN THIS REPO —
relocate-vault.sh/.ps1, relocate-machinery-sidecar.sh/.ps1 and the SessionStart
footprint signal all route through it, so those surfaces cannot drift from each
other. Same porcelain shape as check-cloud-sync.py, which the same callers
already use.

It is NOT the only implementation of the contract. `mycelium-studio` reimplements
these rules natively in Rust, because a desktop app cannot assume python is on
PATH. Read scripts/paired-implementations.json (contract `vault-target-refusal`)
before changing the rules here: an earlier version of this paragraph claimed
there was "no drift between surfaces" full stop, and that sentence is how the
Studio twin shipped without this guard at all (MYC-4035).

Usage:
  check-vault-target.py <path>                # human-readable verdict + remedy
  check-vault-target.py --porcelain <path>    # one machine-readable line
  check-vault-target.py --for-init <path>     # ALSO require positive vault
                                              # evidence — the caller is about
                                              # to create a repo at <path>

Exit codes:
  0  OK     — safe to treat as a vault
  1  REFUSE — unsafe target (see the porcelain token for which rule fired)
  2  USAGE  — bad arguments

Porcelain first token:
  OK_VAULT
  REFUSE_HOME:<what>          $HOME, a filesystem root, or a strict ancestor of
                              $HOME. The caller must NOT offer --force here.
  REFUSE_CREDENTIALS:<names>  credential material sits at the top level
  REFUSE_NOT_A_VAULT:<why>    --for-init only: nothing says this is a vault

POLICY SPLIT — the checker REPORTS, the caller ENFORCES. REFUSE_HOME is
absolute: no legitimate setup makes a home directory an AI-brain vault, and a
--force on it is the one an agent reaches for at 2am. The other two are
heuristics and callers may honour --force on them, loudly.
