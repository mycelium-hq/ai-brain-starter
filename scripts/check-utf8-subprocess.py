"""check-utf8-subprocess.py - the READ half of the cp1252 guard.

scripts/check-utf8-stdout.py (#313) fails a CLI that PRINTS non-ASCII without
reconfiguring its own stdout to UTF-8. This is the mirror image: a process that
READS a child's output without pinning the decode.

    subprocess.run([...], capture_output=True, text=True)      # <- the bug
    subprocess.run([...], capture_output=True, text=True,
                   encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")          # <- the fix

`text=True` alone decodes with locale.getpreferredencoding(False): cp1252 on a
Spanish/French/Portuguese Windows, cp437 under cmd.exe, ASCII in a C-locale
pipe. Nearly every child in this repo prints a VAULT PATH, and every vault path
contains "gear Meta" - U+FE0F, whose 0x8F byte is unmapped in cp1252. The
decode raises UnicodeDecodeError inside subprocess.run(), before the caller
sees a single byte.

WHY THIS IS A LINT AND NOT A TEST
    The failure is invisible on the machine that writes the code. A developer
    on macOS (UTF-8 locale) and CI on Linux (UTF-8 locale) both pass forever;
    the crash only exists on a Windows install in a non-English locale. It has
    now shipped twice:

      - #313, the WRITE side: sync-vault-scripts.ps1 read an empty result and
        misreported it as "no Meta folder".
      - 2026-07-31, the READ side: install-hooks-user-level.py reported "could
        NOT link Claude Code memory into the vault" on machines where the
        linker was fine, and the user's memory stayed in ~/.claude.

    The second one is what this gate exists to prevent a third time.

THE RATCHET - scripts/utf8-subprocess-baseline.txt
    Same shape as scripts/cloud-safe-walker-baseline.txt and
    scripts/vault-root-read-baseline.txt: each pre-existing offender is pinned
    by the SHA-256 of its LF-normalized source.

      - A file NOT in the baseline fails immediately. New code cannot add one.
      - A pinned file whose content CHANGES fails: if you are already editing
        it, fix the call while you are in there. That is how the backlog drains
        without a risky 40-file sweep.
      - A pinned file that becomes clean fails as STALE, so the baseline cannot
        rot into a permanent amnesty list.

    Hashes are computed on LF-normalized text so a CRLF checkout (every Windows
    clone - the platform this gate is FOR) produces the same digest.

SCOPE
    Tracked scripts/*.py and hooks/*.py, matching check-utf8-stdout.py. hooks/
    is the higher-severity surface: a hook that raises mid-gate either fails
    open (the protection the user believes in is not there) or denies every
    tool call with no legible cause.

OPT-OUT
    `# utf8-subprocess-ok: <reason>` on the subprocess.run line, for a child
    whose output is genuinely bytes-safe and where the locale decode is wanted.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/check-utf8-subprocess.py              # lint the fleet
    python3 scripts/check-utf8-subprocess.py --self-test  # prove it still bites
    python3 scripts/check-utf8-subprocess.py --write-baseline   # re-pin

Stdlib only (ast/hashlib/json/subprocess). No network, no writes except
--write-baseline.
