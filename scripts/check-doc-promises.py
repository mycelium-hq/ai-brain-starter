"""Fail RED when a doc promises a command, script, or flag that does not exist.

THE CLASS THIS EXISTS FOR (MYC-4121). This repo is what a brand-new paying
client installs. Eight separate broken promises were found by hand in one
audit: a slash command in the installer's LAST sentence that was never built
(/optimize-brain), a command advertised after its own removal (/mem-search),
scripts documented with a specific ship date that were never added on any
branch, vertical packs sold after deletion, a "git pull to fix it" remedy for
a pack that no longer exists at any pulled ref, a diagnostic that red-flags
the exact thing a test asserts must be off by default, three CLI flags that
appear exactly once in their own skill (the menu line) and nowhere else, and
a cited end-to-end test file that was never written. Nothing caught any of
these before a human read every file by hand. This script is that read,
automated, so it cannot rot back to eight the next time someone edits a doc
faster than the code it describes.

WHAT IT CHECKS, per file under README.md / docs/ (except CHANGELOG.md, which
is an intentionally historical dev log -- see EXCLUDED_DOC_FILES) / phases/ /
skills/*/SKILL.md:

  1. Every backtick- or bold-wrapped slash command (`/foo`, `/foo bar`,
     **/foo**) resolves to a real skill or command -- the union of every
     `name:` in **/SKILL.md, every commands/*.md filename stem, and every
     bare /word inside a SKILL.md's OWN frontmatter block (a skill's own
     claim about its own aliases is authoritative; see
     build_command_vocabulary's docstring for why /journal, /weekly, and
     /health all resolve despite matching no name: or directory). Only the
     first hyphenated token is checked, so `/graphify query` checks
     "graphify" (subcommands are not separately validated).
  2. Every backtick-wrapped `scripts/*.py` reference resolves to a real file,
     checked repo-root-relative, sibling-relative to the referencing file,
     and (for a bare "scripts/NAME.py" with no deeper prefix) against every
     skills/*/scripts/NAME.py -- the documented convention for a skill's own
     bundled scripts.
  3. (cheap extension) Every `--flag` shown in a SKILL.md usage/menu code
     fence appears somewhere else in that skill's own directory. A flag that
     appears exactly once -- the menu line and nowhere else -- is exactly
     the shape of the three inert graphify flags this ticket found by hand.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY EXEMPT, and why (a guard that cries wolf gets ignored):
  - A line containing "removed in v" (case-insensitive): the repo's own
    correction convention -- keep the historical mention, append a
    parenthetical, do not scrub the record. See docs/RELEASES.md.
  - A line whose table row starts with an HTTP verb (GET/POST/...): that is
    an API route table (docs/AGENTS.md's memory-api endpoints), not a slash
    command, even though `/healthz` matches the same character pattern.
  - NON_COMMAND_TOKENS: Unix top-level directories that happen to start with
    a letter after the leading slash (/tmp, /var, ...); Claude Code's own
    built-in slash commands (/compact, /plugin, ...), which this repo does
    not ship; the superpowers bundle's skill names, which POWER_TOOLS.md
    documents as installed from an EXTERNAL repo (obra/superpowers), not
    this one; docs/SESSION_CLOSE.md's own words for its exit-detector
    keywords ("They are detector keywords, not registered commands");
    "skill-name" / "command", generic placeholders used when documenting the
    naming PATTERN itself, not a real instance of it; and "panel" /
    "decision" / "goal", cross-cutting feature words that appear backticked
    in several skills' own descriptions (coaching, health-context,
    repurpose-talk, note-todos) as a shared concept, never as one skill's
    registered trigger.
  Every exemption above is a documented, bounded category, not an
  appendable list. A skill NAME can never be added to NON_COMMAND_TOKENS to
  silence a real gap -- ship the skill instead.

Run `--self-test` for the negative controls: a fixture doc line naming a
command that will never exist must turn this RED. A guard earns trust only
by failing on the thing it catches.

# Every file read in this module calls safe_read_text(...) DIRECTLY, inline
# at the read site -- never through a further wrapper function.
# scripts/check-cloud-safe-file-walkers.py's AST check looks for a direct
# call to one of SAFE_READ_NAMES in the same function that performs the
# recursive glob; a wrapper one level removed reads as an unguarded reader
# to that check, even though it calls safe_read_text internally. This
# module walks the whole doc tree with a recursive glob (**/SKILL.md,
# docs/**/*.md, ...), and a recursive walk over a cloud-synced checkout can
# hand back a placeholder file whose read blocks indefinitely
# (hooks/_lib/safe_read.py's own docstring). A doc-accuracy linter has no
# reason to hang the whole CI job on one placeholder file, so every call
# site uses the pattern `safe_read_text(p, timeout=5.0, max_bytes=4_000_000,
# errors="replace").text or ""` -- non-ok reads simply contribute no
# vocabulary and no findings, the same tolerance a bare errors="replace"
# was reaching for, just bounded in time and size too.

# the failure being fixed, one level up. Both team-onboarding directories
# (for-teams/, para-equipos/ -- a paying client's first surface, EN and ES)

#   /plan (phases/phase-19-23-finish.md) and /code-security
#   (skills/sunday-review/SKILL.md) are both paid-tier capabilities that live

#   Neither was ever planned or built here (no file on any ref, zero mentions
#   across CHANGELOG.md), and neither is an externally installable tool like
#   the obra/superpowers bundle POWER_TOOLS.md documents, so there is no
#   "install from X" note to write: X is private. The prose was rewritten to
#   drop the command and keep the advice. Layer 3 of the security-cadence
#   model now states plainly that this repo does not ship that layer --
#   security-snapshot (passive, external-only) and secret-warn (edit-time
#   guardrails) both explicitly disclaim deep review, so neither could stand
#   in for it. The "removed in v" convention deliberately does NOT apply:
#   nothing was removed from this repo, and writing it would both fabricate
