install-hooks-user-level.py — install ai-brain-starter hooks at USER level.

Closes mycelium-hq/ai-brain-starter#6 — UserPromptSubmit hooks silently fail
in worktrees when installed at project level. User-level hooks
(~/.claude/settings.json) fire universally regardless of worktree.

What it does:
  1. Reads the canonical hooks.json from the skill repo
  2. Reads existing ~/.claude/settings.json (preserves all user content)
  3. Merges ai-brain-starter hooks into the user-level config
  4. De-duplicates by command-string fingerprint (idempotent re-runs)
  5. Backs up the existing settings.json before edit
  6. Verifies post-write JSON validity, rolls back on parse error

Safety:
  - Backup at ~/.claude/settings.json.bak-{timestamp} before any edit
  - JSON validity verified after write; rollback on parse error
  - Custom user hooks NEVER removed (we only add ai-brain-starter entries)
  - Idempotent: a second run detects already-installed hooks via fingerprint
  - --dry-run shows the planned merge without writing
  - --uninstall removes ONLY the ai-brain-starter entries (matched by
    fingerprint substring); leaves everything else intact

Usage:
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py                          # install
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --dry-run                # preview
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --uninstall              # remove
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --hooks-source PATH      # custom source
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --quiet                  # only summary
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --verify                 # install, then verify
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --verify-only            # verify only, writes nothing

Why user-level: project-level hooks at <project>/.claude/settings.json
silently don't fire when cwd is inside <project>/.claude/worktrees/<name>/.
The Claude Code hook resolver appears to treat .claude/ as a boundary it
won't cross when looking up project hooks. User-level config is universal —
fires on every session regardless of cwd.

We ship hooks.json as the canonical source. This script is the install
mechanism; the source-of-truth content lives in hooks.json.

# in-process, PR #446). Deliberately LARGER than the inner bound rather than
# equal to it: the runner's watchdog masks a hung hook cleanly — fallback JSON,
# exit 0, no visible error — and it only gets to do that if it fires first. An
# equal value is a race, and the side that wins is the one that reports a killed
# hook to the user. This bound is what still applies when the RUNNER is the

# !! THIS LIST DOES NOT INSTALL ANYTHING. !!
#
# Membership here confers OWNERSHIP only: dedup, replace, retire, uninstall
# recognition. `merge_hooks()` wires exactly what `hooks.json` declares and
# nothing else, so **hooks.json is the ONLY activation predicate**. A hook
# added here but not to hooks.json is an "owned dormant hook": the installer
# claims it, inspection makes it look registered, and it never fires.
#
# Adding a hook therefore takes BOTH:
#   1. an entry in hooks.json  <- this is what actually installs it
#   2. an entry here (+ ABS_OWNED_BASENAMES) so re-installs dedup it properly
#
# If it signals by EXIT CODE 2 (a blocking gate), wire it in hooks.json as
# `if [ -f <path> ]; then <path>; else <allow-json>; fi` — the common
# `<path> 2>/dev/null || echo <allow-json>` idiom discards the stderr message
# AND rewrites the block into an allow.
#
# This comment replaced "Extend this list when adding new hooks", which read as
# the complete instruction and is how the most recent dormant hook happened:
# the author registered in both lists below, believed it was active, and said
# so in the commit message. Tracked as MYC-1031 (structural CI gate).

# hooks.json guards each of these with `[ -f <path> ] &&`, so a missing file is

# the wrong install behaviour: nothing in the repo ever copied these three, no
# phase doc mentions them, and they were absent from ABS_OWNED_BASENAMES, so
# verification skipped them too. Net effect: wired in 11 places in a real
# settings.json, present on disk 0 times, reported OK. Shipped-but-never-once-
# executed, on every install, since they were merged (#313's follow-on).
#
# retry-budget.py, validate-mcp-json.py and vault-context.py joined this set
# 2026-08-13, from a field report on a Windows install where all three were
# absent from ~/.claude/hooks/. They used to take the PHASE-DOC route: three
# literal `cp` lines in phases/phase-05-context-layer.md, executed by the MODEL
# during /setup-brain. Three things were wrong with that:
#
#   1. POSIX-ONLY. `cp` and `mkdir -p` are not commands on native Windows, so
#      the step could not run there at all — and its failure is invisible,
#      because the `[ -f ]` guard turns every missing hook into silence.
#   2. MODEL-EXECUTED. A copy step that depends on an agent reading a markdown
#      table and choosing to run it is not a deploy route; it is a suggestion.
#      Nothing verified it afterwards on any platform.
#   3. THE DEPENDENCY WAS NEVER SHIPPED. vault-context.py does
#      `from _lib.vault_root import vault_root_for` and falls back to a stub
#      returning None when that import fails. Nothing ever copied hooks/_lib/
#      to ~/.claude/hooks/, so even a SUCCESSFUL `cp` of the .py landed a hook
#      that resolved no vault and injected nothing, on every platform, forever
#      — fail-open, exit 0, no output. See HOME_HOOKS_LIB_DEPS.
#
# The phase doc no longer copies them (its `cp` lines are gone). Do not add one
# back: scripts/check-home-hook-deploy.py fails on BOTH routes as loudly as on
# neither, because a phase doc offering a choice the installer already made is

    Returns an absolute interpreter path when one can be PROVEN to parse as a
    bare first token in every shell on this machine, else the bare PATH name it
    was resolved from (`py -3` / `python` / `python3`), else None.

    WHY THE ABSOLUTE PATH IS WORTH IT (MYC-3877). `py -3` is a launcher STUB:
    py.exe starts, re-reads the PEP 514 registry to find a Python 3, and only
    then starts the interpreter. Measured 21 ms per spawn on an Intel i5-9300H
    / Windows 11 with live AV — about 11% of the per-hook cost, paid on every
    hook of every tool call, to re-derive an answer that does not change between
    installs. Resolving it once here and writing the result removes it.

    BOTH GUARANTEES OF THE OLD BARE `py` ARE KEPT:
      * bare, unquoted, space-free, ASCII first token — enforced by
        _win_bare_token_candidates() and PROVEN per machine by
        _token_parses_in_every_shell(), which refuses anything a present shell
        will not run. Nothing unproven is ever written.
      * the Microsoft Store alias stub is still filtered, and now more strictly:
        _probe_interpreter() requires a real CPython 3 to answer back, where the
        old probe accepted any exit-0.

    `-X utf8` is appended by _with_utf8_mode() once the whole prefix is proven:
    the hook runs IN the runner's interpreter now, so UTF-8 Mode has to be on at
    ITS startup — there is no child env left to put PYTHONUTF8 in.

    Escape hatches: ABS_WIN_LAUNCHER (space-separated tokens) overrides
    everything verbatim, as before — including UTF-8 Mode, so anyone using it to
    pin an exact command line still gets exactly what they wrote.
    ABS_WIN_ABS_INTERPRETER=0 keeps the bare launcher for anyone who wants their
    hooks to follow PATH, and ABS_WIN_UTF8_MODE=0 drops `-X utf8`; both can only
    turn an optimization off, never gate the working default."""

    into a form native Windows can execute.

    Why: hooks.json commands use `python3 X 2>/dev/null || echo JSON` and
    `[ -f X ] && ... || true`. Depending on Claude Code version + settings,
    Windows runs hook commands under PowerShell 5.1 (no `||`), PowerShell 7,
    cmd.exe (no `[ -f ]`, no /dev/null), or Git Bash — no one-liner survives
    all four, so before this rewrite every hook errored visibly on every
    prompt for Windows users. The one shape they all parse identically is a
    bare PATH command with quoted arguments:

        <interpreter> "<abs>/scripts/hook_runner.py" --fallback silent "<abs>/<hook>.py"

    <interpreter> comes from _windows_launcher(): the absolute path `py -3`
    resolves to when that path can be PROVEN to parse bare in every shell on
    this machine, else the bare `py -3` / `python` / `python3` it came from.
    See that function for why the spelling is not a free choice.

    hook_runner.py reproduces the masking semantics of the shell forms (see
    its docstring): missing script -> fallback JSON; exit 2 -> real block
    propagates; any other failure -> fallback JSON. It runs the hook IN ITS OWN
    PROCESS: one interpreter per hook, never two (MYC-3877).

    Rules per command:
      - references a .sh script  -> OMIT (bash-only; reported to the caller)
      - references .py script(s) -> rewrite to the runner form. In fallback
        chains (`python3 vault-copy || python3 home-copy`) the LAST path wins:
        it is the ~/.claude home copy, the one guaranteed space-free and
        present on every install.
      - the target's own ARGUMENTS follow it, forwarded through the runner
        (whose argv contract is `[--fallback MODE] <target> [extra...]`). Only
        real arguments survive, never the POSIX masking noise that trails every
        template command — see _hook_script_args. Dropping them made
        `lint-claude-settings.py --test` platformize to a byte-identical copy of
        the plain entry, so dedup collapsed the pair and the linter's self-test
        never ran on Windows.
      - fallback flavor: `allow` when the original masked to a PreToolUse
        permissionDecision, else `silent`.
      - every rewritten entry carries "timeout": WINDOWS_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS.
        The POSIX shell forms never needed one; the runner form does, because
        `subprocess.run(..., timeout=45)` went away with the child process
        (PR #446). hook_runner.py carries its own watchdog, and this is the
        second, outer bound: it is the one that still applies if the runner is
        the thing that wedged. merge_hooks() replaces the whole entry dict, so
        an existing install picks it up on the next run with no migration.

    Identity, not ownership, is the safe warrant here. Two byte-identical command
    strings under the same matcher fire the same process on the same event; there
    is no configuration in which running it twice is what the user meant. So this
    pass needs no allowlist and cannot drift out of date with one.

    Deliberately narrow, because the entries it touches are UNOWNED and may be the

      * only EXACT string matches collapse. A POSIX `python3 ~/...` variant and a

    ensure_ascii=True (JSON's default) is load-bearing, not style (#397). This is

    consumer whose encoding we do not control. On Windows, Claude Code hands hook
    commands to a shell running a legacy code page: a settings.json carrying raw
    UTF-8 gets decoded there as cp1252/cp437, an account directory named "Ñoño"
    comes back as "Ã‘oÃ±o", the absolute hook path stops resolving, and EVERY hook
    fails — which blocks Bash and Grep for the whole session (47, then 132, then
    104 dead paths across one reporter's three reinstalls). Escaping non-ASCII to
    \\uXXXX makes the file pure ASCII, which decodes identically under UTF-8,
    cp1252, cp437 and latin-1, so no consumer's code page can corrupt a path.

    JSON semantics are untouched — "\\u00f3" and "ó" parse to the same string — so

    _ascii_safe_win_path() (#430). That one is necessary but not sufficient: 8.3

    # it, a fallback chain whose first path is quoted — `python3 '<vault>' ...`
    # — leaves `python3  2>/dev/null` after the quoted path is stripped for the
    # bare pass, and the bare pattern would capture `2>/dev/null` as a bogus
    # "missing required path" (MYC-2558). A shell redirection is not a script.
