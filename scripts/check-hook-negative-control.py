"""Fail when a shipped hook has NO test surface -- nothing that could ever prove
it fires.

THE CLASS. A guard that never fires is AMBIGUOUS, and the two readings are
byte-identical from outside:

  * CORRECTLY QUIET -- the dangerous thing never happened. A smoke detector
    that never went off is not a broken smoke detector.
  * DEAD -- the matcher is wrong, the wiring is stale, an exception is
    swallowed. It will also never fire when the dangerous thing DOES happen.

You cannot tell these apart by observation, because "quiet" and "dead" emit the
same signal: nothing. The only thing that separates them is a NEGATIVE CONTROL
-- a test that hands the guard the input it claims to catch and asserts it
fires. Absent that, "we ship guard X" is a claim about a FILE, not about
behavior.

WHY THIS IS A FOURTH, DISJOINT CHECK. The existing checks ask:

  check-hook-activation.py        is it wired?      (can it be reached)
  check-hook-activation.py (B)    is it owned?      (will the installer manage it)
  check-hook-emission-channel.py  can it speak?     (will anyone hear it)
  THIS ONE                        can it be proven? (does anything test it)

All four can disagree. A hook can be wired, owned, able to speak, and still
have a matcher that matches nothing on any real input. Overlapping these would
double-report one file, so this check does exactly one thing.

WHAT THIS PREDICATE IS, PRECISELY. It asserts that at least one test surface in
the repo NAMES the hook. That is a FLOOR, not proof:

  * It DOES catch the worst case -- a guard shipped with zero test surface,
    where no one has ever attempted to prove it can fire. That is the
    population this check exists for.
  * It does NOT prove the test actually exercises the failure path, or that
    the assertion is meaningful. A test naming a hook can still be vacuous.

Claiming more than this would be the same error the check is about, so the
message says "no test surface", never "untested" or "unproven".

A CONTROL CAN ALSO FAIL FOR THE WRONG REASON, which is subtler than vacuous
and reads as more rigorous. Measured 2026-08-28 (PR #610): a test with four
real assertions, naming the right function, still passed with the fix reverted
-- three fixtures running, because each tripped a DIFFERENT guard in the same
call path (the mkdir guard, then the load guard, then the lock) and every one
of them raised the expected exception TYPE from the wrong SITE. The assertion
was about an outcome, and several distinct failures produce that same outcome;
the more fail-closed guards a function has, the likelier a crude fixture trips
an earlier one. So: revert the specific fix and require RED, and when it stays
green find which guard actually fired instead of adjusting the assertion. Two
harness traps in the same family -- a mutation whose search string no longer
matches silently mutates nothing, and `grep -c '[FAIL]'` scores a CRASHED suite
as zero failures, identical to a clean pass. Assert the mutation applied; read
the exit code.

  * The name match is a SUBSTRING match, so a hook named `retry-budget` counts
    as covered by a test that only mentions `retry-budget-v2`. That error runs
    in the PERMISSIVE direction (a false GREEN, never a false accusation),
    which is the correct bias for a ratchet: it can under-report debt, but it
    can never fail a hook that someone did test.

SCOPE IS THE FAILURE MODE OF THIS KIND OF CHECK. A coverage check that scans
one directory reports every hook tested elsewhere as untested, and the number
looks authoritative either way. This scans EVERY test surface in the repo and
PRINTS the count it scanned, so a reader can see the denominator rather than
trust it. (Found the hard way: a first pass here scanned `tests/` only, missed
`tests/integration/` and `hooks/test_*.py`, and produced a confidently wrong
figure in both directions.)

BASELINE RATCHET. This ships with pre-existing debt, so it runs as a ratchet,
matching scripts/check-hook-activation.py: listed names are tolerated, the list
may never GROW, and a name that gains a test surface or disappears must be
REMOVED (a stale entry fails). Debt can only shrink. A NEW hook cannot ship
without a test surface.
