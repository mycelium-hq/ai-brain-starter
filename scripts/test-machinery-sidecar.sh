# Negative-control + churn-burst test for relocate-machinery-sidecar.sh.
#
# The Done= predicate for the "vault may live in iCloud" mode is: after a full
# churn burst (worktree create + commits + `git gc`) on a vault, ZERO machinery
# CONTENT bytes live inside the (synced) vault tree — only static symlinks + the
# one-line `.git` pointer remain. We can't drive iCloud in CI, so we model
# "synced scope" as the vault tree itself and assert the heavy machinery content
# is OUT of it. `find -type f` does not follow symlinks, so relocated content
# (symlinked to the sidecar) is correctly counted as "out of tree".
#
# A guard earns trust only by failing on the thing it catches: the NEGATIVE
# CONTROL repeats the identical churn on a NON-relocated vault and asserts the
# machinery IS in-tree there — proving the metric discriminates.
