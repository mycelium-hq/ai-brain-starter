"""check-utf8-file-io.py - fail-loud guard against locale-encoded FILE I/O.

THE GAP THIS FILLS
------------------
Two sibling lints already cover the Windows cp1252 class at its edges:

    check-utf8-stdout.py      - what a script PRINTS to the console
    check-utf8-subprocess.py  - what a script READS BACK from a subprocess

Nothing covered the third and most durable edge: what a script WRITES TO and
READS FROM A FILE. `open(p, "w")`, `Path.write_text(s)` and `Path.read_text()`
in text mode with no `encoding=` use `locale.getpreferredencoding(False)`, which
is **cp1252 on a stock Windows box** and UTF-8 on macOS/Linux. The artifact is
therefore encoded differently depending on whose machine produced it, while the
code reads identically on review.

HOW IT ACTUALLY BITES (all three measured, none of them announce themselves)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. WRITE, silent corruption. `build-journal-index.py` wrote journal-index.json
   via `open(path, "w")` + `json.dump(..., ensure_ascii=False)`. On Windows a
   single accented title ("Reunión", "día") was written as cp1252 bytes into a
   file every consumer opens as UTF-8. The write raised NOTHING and the script
   printed "Indexed 2 entries" and exited 0; /weekly, /monthly, diagnose and
   insight-fact-check then died on
   `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xed`.

2. READ, silent mojibake. Reading a UTF-8 note under cp1252 usually does NOT
   raise: accents, em dashes, emoji and CJK all decode into WRONG characters
   ("Andrés" -> "AndrÃ©s"). Any regex or comparison then runs against text that
   is not what the file says, and under-matches quietly.

3. READ, silent skip. Five byte values are UNDEFINED in cp1252 (0x81, 0x8D,
   0x8F, 0x90, 0x9D). Curly quotes hit 0x9D and the gear emoji in this repo's
   own "⚙️ Meta" folder name hits 0x8F, so those reads RAISE - and a bare
   `except Exception: continue` around a read turns that into a skipped file
   that looks exactly like "nothing to do here".

WHY A MAINTAINER CANNOT SEE THIS
--------------------------------
`PYTHONUTF8=1` in the environment (and Windows' "Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8"
setting) forces UTF-8 mode, so `getpreferredencoding()` returns "utf-8" and the
whole class disappears. A box with it set can never reproduce a student's
report. That is not an exotic setup - it is set on the machine this lint was
written on. The bug is invisible where it is maintained and fatal where it is
installed, which is exactly why it needs a gate rather than vigilance.

THE PROVABLY-SAFE EXEMPTION
---------------------------
`json.dumps(x)` / `json.dump(x, f)` default to `ensure_ascii=True`, so the
payload is pure ASCII and cp1252 and UTF-8 agree byte for byte. Those sites are
NOT flagged - the same empirical exemption #417 applied to 42 of 78 hook files.
Passing `ensure_ascii=False` removes the exemption, because non-ASCII can then
reach the file.

SCOPE - state it, because a guard's scan scope IS its blind spot
----------------------------------------------------------------
    scripts/*.py, hooks/*.py, AND skills/**/scripts/*.py

The third pathspec is deliberate. check-utf8-stdout.py shipped scanning only
scripts/*.py while its docs claimed it covered every vault CLI; hooks/ - 113
tracked files - had never been looked at (MYC-3530). This repo also ships
Python under skills/, including the graphify pipeline that writes report and
graph artifacts derived from the user's own notes, so leaving it out would
repeat that exact mistake on day one.

THE RATCHET - scripts/utf8-file-io-baseline.txt
-----------------------------------------------
The pre-existing population is pinned by SHA-256 of newline-normalized content,
matching utf8-stdout-baseline.txt and vault-root-read-baseline.txt. A pinned
file may keep its violations until it is touched; EDITING it changes the hash
and fails the build until it is fixed. A file NOT in the baseline gets no grace
period at all. The baseline is a BACKLOG, NOT A SET OF PARDONS.
