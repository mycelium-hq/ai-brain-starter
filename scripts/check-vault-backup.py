"""Guard: detect whether a vault has ANY off-machine backup at all.

The failure this prevents: a brain in active daily use whose ONLY copy is the
local disk it runs on. One disk failure = everything gone. It is silent — the
vault works perfectly right up until the drive dies — which is exactly why it
needs a loud, repeated signal rather than a doc nobody reads.

A vault counts as backed up if ANY of these holds (cheapest checks first):

  1. vault-backup    — `scripts/vault-backup.sh` is configured for this vault
                       AND a real archive exists in a reachable destination.
  2. Time Machine    — a destination is configured (macOS `tmutil`). The
                       OS-default off-machine path; counts even if a disk is
                       currently unplugged (the strategy exists).
  3. cloud copy      — the vault path resolves inside a consumer cloud-sync
                       root (iCloud / OneDrive / Dropbox / Google Drive / Box).
                       A churny, sub-optimal backup (see docs/CLOUD_SYNC.md and
                       worktree-footprint-signal.py, which owns nagging about
                       that combo) — but it IS an off-machine copy, so it
                       suppresses the no-backup alarm here.
  4. git remote      — the vault is a git repo with a remote AND the current
                       HEAD has been pushed (exists on a remote branch).

This is the SINGLE source of truth for "is there a backup" — the SessionStart
hook (surface-backup-status.py), diagnose.sh/.ps1, and the phase-01 onboarding
gate all route through it so the surfaces never drift.

Usage:
  check-vault-backup.py <vault-path>          # human-readable verdict + remedy
  check-vault-backup.py --porcelain <path>    # one machine-readable line
  check-vault-backup.py --ignore-cloud <path> # don't count a cloud-sync copy as
                                              # a backup (for callers about to
                                              # REMOVE it, e.g. relocate-vault.sh)

Exit codes:
  0  BACKED UP  — at least one off-machine copy/strategy detected
  1  NO BACKUP  — none detected (the one-disk-failure class)
  2  USAGE      — bad arguments

Porcelain first token (parse by splitting on ':'):
  BACKED_UP:vault-backup:<age_days>   — our archive present, <age_days> old
  BACKED_UP:timemachine               — Time Machine destination configured
  BACKED_UP:cloud:<service>           — vault inside a cloud-sync root
  BACKED_UP:git-remote                — vault git HEAD pushed to a remote
  NO_BACKUP                           — nothing detected
  NO_BACKUP:configured-not-run        — vault-backup configured, but no archive
                                        in the destination yet (or dest gone)
