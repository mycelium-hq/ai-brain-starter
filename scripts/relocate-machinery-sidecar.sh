# exit-contract: NOT-A-CHECKER -- relocates machinery out of a sync folder;
#   its guards are preconditions

# relocate-machinery-sidecar.sh — make a vault SAFE to keep inside iCloud / a
# cloud-sync folder by moving every churning machinery dir OUT of the synced
# tree into a local sidecar, leaving only tiny static pointers/symlinks behind.
#
# PAIRED IMPLEMENTATION. This behaviour is implemented more than once by hand.
# Every implementation is listed in scripts/paired-implementations.json under
# `machinery-sidecar/1`. Check that list before changing behaviour here: this
# contract has drifted three times (MYC-1088, MYC-4035, and the python
# interpreter probe), and every time it was this file — the original — that got
# edited by someone with no idea a twin existed.
#
# WHY
# ---
# A git-backed Obsidian vault inside iCloud Drive / Desktop & Documents melts the
# OS sync daemon — NOT because of the notes (markdown is tiny + low-churn) but
# because of the MACHINERY: a `.git` rewritten wholesale on `git gc`, per-session
# worktree checkouts (~thousands of files each), and search/index caches. The
# fix is not "turn iCloud off". The fix is: the vault MAY be synced; the
# machinery NEVER is. This script relocates the machinery and leaves the docs.
#
# CRITICAL: `.gitignore` does NOT stop iCloud. iCloud syncs the folder, not
# git's view of it. The bytes must physically leave the synced tree (relocate +
# symlink) or be flagged `.nosync` (iCloud ignores any name ending in .nosync).
#
# THE ONE RULE: IT NEVER MOVES ANYTHING GIT TRACKS
# ------------------------------------------------
# Every candidate below is tested against the REAL git index before it is
# touched. A path holding tracked content is your NOTES, whatever it is named —
# moving it turns the directory into a symlink, `git status` reports every file
# as deleted, and the next auto-commit/push propagates that deletion to every
# machine. So: tracked content -> never moved, reported, left exactly as it is.
# Genuinely ignored/untracked caches still move. If the index cannot be read,
# the path is left alone (a path I cannot prove is a cache is not a cache).
#
# WHAT IT MOVES (only when the path holds NO tracked content)
#   .git              -> <sidecar>/git    via `git init --separate-git-dir`
#                        (leaves a one-line `.git` POINTER FILE — static, safe)
#   .claude/worktrees -> <sidecar>/worktrees  (relocate + symlink; MYC-543 layer)
#   caches            -> <sidecar>/cache/<name> (relocate + symlink, or .nosync)
#                        .smart-env .codegraph "⚙️ Meta/graphify-out"
#                        "⚙️ Meta/Sessions" "⚙️ Meta/Worktree Snapshots"
#                        "⚙️ Meta/logs"  (only those that exist as REAL dirs)
#                        NOTE several of these names hold TRACKED notes in a real
#                        vault. They are candidates only — the index test
#                        decides, never the name.
#
# SEQUENCING GOTCHA (verified): `git init --separate-git-dir` ORPHANS existing
# linked worktrees. So this REFUSES to run while any linked worktree or live
# Claude session exists, unless --force. After relocation it runs
# `git worktree repair`. The probes FAIL CLOSED: if git or the session lock
# cannot be read, that counts as LIVE and the run is refused. "I could not look"
# and "I looked and it was empty" are different answers.
#
# SAFETY: idempotent (re-run = no-op report), interrupt-safe (every move is
# written to an append-only journal in the sidecar BEFORE it happens, so
# --rollback works from any kill point), reversible (--rollback reads that
# record and puts everything back, exits non-zero and KEEPS the record if any
# leg fails), --dry-run changes nothing, and it never deletes content — only
# moves it and leaves a symlink/pointer.
#
# The SIDECAR DESTINATION is checked with the same cloud-sync detector as the
# vault: relocating machinery from one synced tree into another (a redirected
# $HOME on a roaming/OneDrive profile) does not fix the melt, so it is refused.
#
# Pure bash + git + python3 (JSON only). No third-party deps.
#
# Usage:
#   relocate-machinery-sidecar.sh <vault-path> [options]
#   relocate-machinery-sidecar.sh <vault-path> --rollback
#
# Options:
#   --sidecar <dir>   sidecar root (default: $BRAIN_SIDECAR or ~/.brain-sidecar)
#   --nosync          keep caches in-tree as <name>.nosync (iCloud-ignored) +
#                     symlink, instead of relocating them to the sidecar
#   --dry-run         print intended actions, change nothing
#   --rollback        reverse a previous relocation using the recorded moves
#   --force           proceed even if linked worktrees / live sessions exist, a
#                     probe could not run, or the sidecar looks cloud-synced
#                     (DANGEROUS: separate-git-dir orphans live worktrees)
#   --quiet           only print warnings/errors + the final summary line
#   -h, --help        this help
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok / no-op · 1 refused (live worktree/session, unsafe sidecar,
#             or a probe that could not run) · 2 usage / nothing to roll back ·
#             3 not a git vault and could not init · 4 partial failure
