# update-check.sh — daily drift detector for the ai-brain-starter setup
#
# Designed to be called by Claude at the start of every session via a CLAUDE.md
# rule. Outputs a structured, parseable result that Claude can translate into
# plain English for the user.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Runs at most once per day (tracked via ~/.claude/.ai-brain-starter-last-check).
#   - If we already checked today: prints UP_TO_DATE and exits 0.
#   - Otherwise: runs `git fetch --quiet` against the user's local clone.
#   - Compares HEAD to origin/main.
#   - If they differ: prints BEHIND, the count of new commits, the new CHANGELOG
#     entries (plain text), and exits 0. The CHANGELOG slice is what Claude
#     translates into plain English for the user.
#   - If they match: prints UP_TO_DATE and exits 0.
#   - Always writes today's date to the check file at the end (success or
#     "nothing to do"), so we don't ask again until tomorrow.
#
# This script never installs anything. It only reports. Installation is done
# by bootstrap.sh, which Claude calls if the user says "yes, install."
#
# Output format (parseable by Claude):
#   STATUS: <UP_TO_DATE | BEHIND | ERROR | SKIPPED_TODAY>
#   COMMITS_BEHIND: <integer>
#   CURRENT_HEAD: <short sha>
#   LATEST_HEAD: <short sha>
#   ---CHANGELOG_NEW---
#   <new CHANGELOG entries since the user's current commit, or empty>
#   ---END---
#
# Usage (called from a Claude session via the CLAUDE.md rule):
#   bash ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/update-check.sh
#
# Force a re-check (bypass the once-per-day cooldown):
#   bash ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/scripts/update-check.sh --force
