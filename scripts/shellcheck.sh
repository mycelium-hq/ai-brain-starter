# scripts/shellcheck.sh - the canonical, locally-runnable shellcheck gate for
# ai-brain-starter. ONE command, shared by two callers so they can never drift:
#
#   1. .github/workflows/lint.yml  - the `shellcheck` job runs `bash scripts/shellcheck.sh`.
#   2. scripts/ci.sh               - section (c) runs `bash scripts/shellcheck.sh`, so the
#                                    local pre-push gate (~/.local/bin/ci-test) runs the
#                                    SAME shellcheck. CI and the laptop cannot drift.
#
# Why this exists: ai-brain-starter ships ~80 tracked *.sh that must run on macOS
# AND Linux (users install on both; CI is ubuntu). `bash -n` (the `shell` lint job)
# is syntax-only - it cannot catch the portability / quoting / correctness class:
# BSD-only flags, unquoted expansions (SC2086), unset vars, exit codes masked by a
# pipe. A real `stat -c %Y` (GNU) vs `stat -f %m` (BSD) mtime bug once passed
# macOS-local + `bash -n` and only failed on the ubuntu CI runner. shellcheck
# catches that class before it ships.
#
# Severity gate: -S warning (error + warning). info/style are NOT failed here, so
# the gate matches the real ship/hold boundary, not the strictest possible signal
# (an over-strict gate just teaches people to bypass it). Raise the floor later, on
# purpose, if the baseline supports it:  SHELLCHECK_SEVERITY=style bash scripts/shellcheck.sh
#
# A genuine false-positive is silenced at the source with an inline shellcheck
# disable directive carrying a one-line reason - never by lowering the gate for
# every file.
#
# Idioms shellcheck does NOT catch (cross-platform stat / date / sed) are
# documented in scripts/PORTABILITY.md.
