#
# scripts/check-ps1-encoding.sh - *.ps1 byte hygiene for Windows PowerShell 5.1.
#
# TWO rules, one scanner:
#
#   BOM      every *.ps1 must BEGIN with a UTF-8 BOM (EF BB BF).
#   EM DASH  no *.ps1 may CONTAIN U+2014 (E2 80 94).
#
# They are one scanner and not two scripts because they run over the same
# enumeration, and the enumeration is where the bugs have actually been: a
# `head -20` cap in one copy silently hid a real defect (#559). A second script
# would mean a second enumeration to cap, mis-glob or point at the wrong tree -
# deduplicating the rule while duplicating the scanner is a half fix.
#
# Why this is correctness, not style. Windows PowerShell 5.1 - the version that
# ships with every Windows 10/11 box, and the one bootstrap.ps1 actually runs
# under - does not assume UTF-8. Without a BOM it reads a .ps1 as the console's
# ANSI code page (cp1252 on a US box, cp1251 on a Russian one), so the first
# non-ASCII byte decodes wrong and the parser dies on a file that is valid UTF-8
# everywhere else. The BOM is how 5.1 is told the encoding.
#
# The em-dash rule is the same failure from the other side. U+2014 was the exact
# byte sequence that crashed the 5.1 parser before the BOM fix, and it is the
# non-ASCII character most likely to arrive by accident - an editor's autocorrect
# or a paste from a doc - in a file where a plain hyphen was meant.
#
# Be precise about what this buys, because it is easy to overstate. If the BOM is
# present, non-ASCII parses fine and this rule is style. If the BOM is ever lost,
# ANY non-ASCII byte breaks the file, and U+2014 is not special among them. So
# this is NOT an ASCII-cleanliness guarantee: 4 of the 14 *.ps1 files here carry
# deliberate non-ASCII (box-drawing rules in section headers, a middle dot in the
# log prefix, the enye in "Espanol", a gear and an arrow) and are intentionally
# untouched. What the rule actually does is close the one hole that opens by
# accident rather than by choice. Widening it to all non-ASCII behind a pinned
# baseline - the pattern utf8-stdout-baseline.txt already uses here - is tracked
# separately (MYC-4040); it is a real decision about those four files, not a bug fix.
#
# ONE implementation, THREE callers, so the rule cannot drift between them:
#
#   1. .github/workflows/lint.yml - the ENFORCING gate. A red here blocks merge.
#      Both rules lived there as inline loops, each with its own `find`.
#   2. scripts/ci.sh              - the locally-runnable pre-push gate, for fast
#      feedback. Before this script existed the rule lived ONLY as an inline
#      loop in lint.yml, so a BOM-less .ps1 passed a full green local
#      `bash scripts/ci.sh` and failed only after a push - one full CI
#      round-trip per occurrence. Measured 2026-08-19 on
#      tests/integration/test_bootstrap_ps1_slash_commands.ps1.
#   3. scripts/diagnose.sh        - the USER-facing health report, via
#      --porcelain. Different target (an installed vault, which is usually not
#      a git repo), different verdict (a warning, not a merge block), same rule.
#      Its private copy was capped at `head -20`, so a vault with more than 20
#      .ps1 files reported "All .ps1 files have UTF-8 BOM" while never reading
#      the rest - and diagnose.ps1, which has no cap, reported the same vault
#      honestly. Folding it in removed the copy and the truncation together.
#
# scripts/diagnose.ps1 is DELIBERATELY not a caller. It is the Windows-native
# surface, run as `pwsh diagnose.ps1 -Vault C:\path` on a box that need not have
# bash at all, and no .ps1 in this repo shells out to bash. This repo's idiom
# for sh/ps1 parity is a shared data source plus a test that reads both (see
# sync-vault-scripts.ps1), not a cross-language call - so the .ps1 keeps its own
# byte check and scripts/test_ps1_encoding_gate.py pins the two to the same bytes.
#
# The drift invariant is pinned by scripts/test_ps1_encoding_gate.py: it fails if any
# caller stops delegating here, if anyone re-inlines a private copy of the byte
# comparison, or if either surface starts capping its enumeration again.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-ps1-encoding.sh                    # scan this repo (gate, both rules)
#   bash scripts/check-ps1-encoding.sh --self-test        # negative control
#   bash scripts/check-ps1-encoding.sh --porcelain DIR... # report on arbitrary trees
