"""
Negative-control tests for graphify's typed-edges review report (Step 4b).

Guards the bug class BLIND-MERGE-CORRUPTS-A-LIVE-GRAPH: Part A.5
(wire_typed_relationships.py) computes real typed edges from frontmatter and
wikilinks, but its output is only ever an LLM skip-list -- nothing merges it
into graph.json. Two things make an automatic merge unsafe:

1. Node IDs in graph.json are LLM-improvised per entity (Part B), not a
   deterministic function of the file path. A wikilink's raw text can resolve
   to zero, one, or several nodes.
2. The four wikilink-derived types (mentions, journaled_about, attended,
   investor_for) already exist in graph.json via Part B with an
   entity -> document direction. Part A.5 reads them the other way
   (document -> wikilink target), so merging as-emitted would contradict the
   existing convention rather than extend it.

review_typed_edges.py resolves what it safely can and buckets the rest for a
human. These tests pin the two properties that make it safe to run on a vault:
graph.json is never written, and only unambiguous, non-duplicate, correctly
oriented edges reach the "ready to merge" bucket.
