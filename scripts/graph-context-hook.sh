# graph-context-hook.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook that injects targeted graph
# context when the user's prompt contains routing keywords.
#
# Companion to the static MANDATORY SESSION PROTOCOL hook in hooks.json.
# That hook always fires once per session. This one fires on EVERY prompt
# but is silent unless the prompt mentions one of your routing keywords.
#
# WHY: If your vault has a knowledge graph (e.g. from /graphify) — or several
# of them, like a personal graph and a separate team/work graph — you want
# Claude to actually OPEN the right graph report before answering instead of
# re-reading 5 source files. Telling Claude this in CLAUDE.md helps; injecting
# it as additionalContext at the moment of the matching prompt helps more.
#
# CUSTOMIZE THIS SCRIPT for your vault:
#   1. Set VAULT_ROOT to your vault path
#   2. Set PRIMARY_GRAPH / SECONDARY_GRAPH to your GRAPH_REPORT.md locations
#      (delete SECONDARY_* if you only have one graph)
#   3. Edit PRIMARY_PATTERN / SECONDARY_PATTERN regexes — list the keywords
#      that should trigger the routing hint for each scope
#   4. Edit the emit_context strings below to describe your scopes
#
# DESIGN NOTES:
#   - The hook does NOT pin specific god-node names. God-node names go stale
#     every graphify run. The stable signal is the PATH and the FRESHNESS DATE.
#     Let the model open the report to get the actual current top nodes.
#   - The hook computes the graph file's mtime and warns "STALE — last updated
#     N days ago" if older than STALE_DAYS, so you know when to re-run graphify.
#   - On no keyword match, emits {"continue":true} (silent passthrough).
#
# TEST IT:
#   echo '{"hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","prompt":"<your test phrase>"}' | bash this-script.sh
