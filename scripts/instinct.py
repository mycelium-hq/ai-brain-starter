instinct.py — Instinct Engine v2 CLI.

The intelligent layer (`/patterns`, `/evolve`) decides WHAT to do; this CLI is
the deterministic mechanism that does it safely. Subcommands:

  backfill     Add confidence/observations/last_seen/project_id to any
               feedback_*/discovery_* memory missing them. Idempotent. Backed up.
  reinforce    A pattern was observed again with no contradiction -> confidence up.
  correct      The user corrected this pattern -> confidence down (sharp).
  decay        Apply staleness decay (catches up memories unseen past the grace
               window; non-compounding; advances last_seen only when value changes).
  recompute    decay + a report. The once-per-period maintenance entry point.
  report       List instincts by effective confidence (filters: --project,
               --min-confidence, --stale, --json).
  export       Emit a portable YAML instinct set (project-scoped + global,
               confidence-gated). Requires PyYAML.
  import       Merge a YAML instinct set with confidence-gated rules (higher wins,
               equal/lower skipped) into <memory>/inherited/. Requires PyYAML.
  evolve       Cluster instincts by domain; for high-confidence clusters, write a
               proposed Command/Skill/Agent scaffold.

Mutation safety: every file that gets a managed-field write keeps a one-time
<file>.bak-instinct snapshot of its pre-engine state. Runs are idempotent — a
second identical run writes nothing.

#   word_boundary catches a short bare name/word WITHOUT matching it as a

# CRITICAL: `\bonde\b` does NOT match inside "ondeplan" (no word boundary
# between "e" and "p"), which is exactly why the compound names
# (ondeplan/onde-platform/onde_team) are their own substring entries instead
# of being folded into the bare `\bonde\b` word-boundary pattern. Merging
# them back into one word-boundary pattern reopens the exact leak this gate
# exists to close. All patterns are matched case-insensitively -- these are
