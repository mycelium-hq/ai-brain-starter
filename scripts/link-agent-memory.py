"""Make Claude Code's per-project memory physically live inside the vault.

THE PROBLEM THIS FIXES
----------------------
Claude Code writes its persistent memory (``MEMORY.md`` + topic files) to
``~/.claude/projects/<encoded-vault>/memory/`` — a per-account, per-machine,
tool-specific directory that is invisible inside Obsidian. For a product whose
entire premise is "your second brain lives in your vault", memory stranded in
``~/.claude/`` is a broken promise: it does not show up in the vault, it is not
in the vault's git history, and it does not survive switching machines or tools.

The substrate already assumed a symlink from that dir into the vault
(``instinct_lib.py`` looks for it, ``relocate-vault.sh`` re-homes it, tests
check it) — but nothing in the install ever CREATED it. This script is that
missing step.

WHAT IT DOES (idempotent, loss-free, never deletes)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Ensures ``<vault>/⚙️ Meta/Agent Memory/`` exists (the vault-side home).
2. Resolves the Claude Code project-memory path for this vault.
3. If that path is a real directory with content, MIGRATES every file into the
   vault dir without loss (same-name-but-different files are kept as
   ``<name>.from-tooldir``), then backs the directory up to
   ``memory.pre-link-backup[-N]`` — never deletes — and replaces it with a
   symlink.
4. If it is missing, creates the symlink directly.
5. If it is already the correct symlink, no-ops.
6. Verifies the end state and FAILS LOUD if the symlink does not resolve to the
   vault dir — a wrong-key silent no-op is the worst outcome.

After this runs, everything Claude Code "remembers" is a file in the user's
vault, visible in Obsidian and tracked by the vault's git.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/link-agent-memory.py --vault "/path/to/vault"
