"""Controls for default-ON auto-GC (MYC-2363).

Every reclaim tool the substrate ships was OPT-IN: `install-vault-daily-
maintenance.sh` was documented and never invoked, so on a default install
NOTHING ever pruned a worktree, a cache, or a merged branch, and the machine
only ever got fuller. "Ships a GC" and "the GC runs" are different claims, and
only the second one matters — so these controls assert ACTIVATION and COVERAGE,
never file presence:

  * the hook installer CALLS the scheduler (not: the scheduler exists)
  * the daily pass covers EVERY reclaim leg (REQUIRED_LEGS below), because a
    bundle that looks complete is how a hole stays invisible: MYC-3727 found
    that not one leg reclaimed build output from a worktree that STAYS, so
    ~130 worktrees held 438 GB while this whole pass ran green daily
  * ABS_NO_AUTO_GC=1 turns it OFF, and nothing else does — no opt-in gates the
    value, because an opt-in default IS the bug
  * the run is gated on battery and on someone being at the keyboard, not just
    on loadavg
  * a non-macOS install still gets a schedule (cron), else the whole pass is
    silently macOS-only while looking installed
