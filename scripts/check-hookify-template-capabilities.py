"""Gate: every shipped hookify template must be evaluable by the OFFICIAL engine.

Why this exists
---------------
We ship `templates/hookify-rules/hookify.*.local.md` for people to copy. They run
the OFFICIAL hookify plugin (anthropics/claude-code -> plugins/hookify). That engine
silently returns False for any operator it does not implement and None for any field
it cannot resolve -- so a template using a capability the official engine lacks LOADS
FINE AND NEVER FIRES. A safety rule that never fires is worse than no rule: it reads
as protection that is not there.

This gate fails loud at CI time instead. Bug class: SILENT-NO-OP-ON-UNEVALUABLE-SPEC.

Capability sets below are transcribed from the official engine. Re-verify with:
    git -C <claude-code> show origin/main:plugins/hookify/core/rule_engine.py
Update them (and shrink KNOWN_UPSTREAM_GAPS) when upstream ships new capabilities.

stdlib only, no PyYAML -- runs under `python3 -S`.
