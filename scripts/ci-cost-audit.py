"""ci-cost-audit.py — find the CI spend leaks in a repo BEFORE they become an invoice.

An AI brain opens many branches at once. That is the point of it — and it is
also why CI cost stops behaving the way people expect. GitHub Actions does not
bill per workflow or per wall-clock minute. It bills:

    per JOB, rounded UP to a whole minute, times the runner multiplier
    (Linux 1x, Windows 2x, macOS 10x)

So the thing that empties an Actions budget is rarely a slow test. It is a wide
fan-out of very short jobs, multiplied by the number of branches in flight. A
workflow with 13 six-second jobs bills 13 minutes, not one. Ten such workflows
across twenty open PRs bills 2,600 minutes for about twenty minutes of work.

This script reports that shape for any repo:

  STATIC  (no network, always runs) — reads .github/workflows/*.yml and flags:
      * jobs that will pay the 1-minute floor for near-zero work
      * expensive runners (macOS/Windows) on per-push triggers
      * missing `concurrency` groups (superseded pushes keep burning)
      * `cancel-in-progress` on merge_group (deadlocks a merge queue)
      * relevance predicates broad enough to match ordinary churn
      * duplicate push+pull_request triggers on the same branch

  MEASURED (--repo owner/name, needs `gh`) — pulls real job records and reports
      actual billed minutes per workflow, the share that is pure rounding, and
      the runner-multiplier concentration. Skipped jobs are EXCLUDED: they never
      allocate a runner and are not billed, and counting them sends you after
      the wrong workflow.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/ci-cost-audit.py                      # static, current repo
    python3 scripts/ci-cost-audit.py --path ../other-repo  # static, elsewhere
    python3 scripts/ci-cost-audit.py --repo owner/name --hours 24
    python3 scripts/ci-cost-audit.py --self-test          # negative controls

Exit: 0 clean or advisory-only, 1 findings at or above --fail-on, 2 bad input.

Operating rule this enforces: "A Cost Gate Is Unproven Until the Burn Rate
Moves" — CI is billed per job, at a one-minute floor, times the runner
multiplier.
