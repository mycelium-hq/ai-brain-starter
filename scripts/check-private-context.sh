# exit-contract: ENFORCING

# Private-context token scan, PR-scoped.
#
# Lives here rather than inline in .github/workflows/lint.yml for the same
# reason check-ps1-encoding.sh does: an inline copy is unreachable locally, so
# it can only be exercised by pushing, and the enforcing gate and any local
# equivalent drift apart silently.
#
# Contract: fail (exit 1) if THIS BRANCH ADDS a line carrying a private-context
# token. Pre-existing committed content is intentionally ignored -- the gate is
# about net-new additions, not legacy text in a file the branch happens to touch.
#
# THE TRAP THIS SCRIPT EXISTS TO NOT FALL INTO: `git diff A..B` (two dots)
# compares the two TIPS. Every line the base changed since the branch forked
# comes back as a `+` on the branch side and gets blamed on the branch. Only
# `git diff A...B` (three dots) diffs from the MERGE BASE, which is the only
# thing that means "what this branch added".
#
# Measured 2026-08-23 on PR #519: two-dot reported 165 files and 10 token hits
# on a PR that touches 3 files and adds none. That false positive stranded ~15
# PRs for weeks -- the over-strict-verification failure mode that teaches people
# to bypass a security gate.
