"""check-vault-root-reads.py - ban naive VAULT_ROOT env reads in vault code.

THE BUG CLASS THIS EXISTS FOR
    `VAULT_ROOT` is routinely exported machine-wide (a shell profile, or Claude
    Code's settings.json `env` block, so every hook subprocess always sees it).
    It names exactly ONE vault. Any code that reads it naively therefore has two
    distinct failure modes, and BOTH are silent:

      1. UNSET  -> the near-universal default `str(Path.home() / "vault")` is
         wrong for every vault not literally named "vault". A guard written this
         way is inert on essentially every install, and says nothing while it is.
      2. SET    -> the env var wins over the vault the caller actually means. A
         file written into vault B resolves against vault A, the containment
         check returns False, and the guard skips the very file it exists for.

    Caught live on hooks/validate-handoff-frontmatter.py (#375/#404), which read
    the env var with a ~/vault default and was inert everywhere. Two unrelated
    users had already hand-patched it identically, each hardcoding their own
    absolute vault path -- when two people patch a defect the same way, the
    upstream default is the bug.

    MYC-2439 fixed 3 scripts; MYC-2504 fixes 5 more. Both are INSTANCE
    remediation. This is the class-level watchdog: the third layer of
    immediate remediation -> per-script hardening -> class-level guard, and the
    twin of scripts/check-meta-resolution.sh (the naive `*Meta` glob ban).

THE RULE
    A read of the VAULT_ROOT environment variable
        os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT", ...) / os.getenv("VAULT_ROOT")
        os.environ["VAULT_ROOT"]
    is a VIOLATION unless one of the following is true:

      (1) it is lexically inside a sanctioned resolver definition (SANCTIONED
          below) -- the one place allowed to decide what the env var means;
      (2) it is an ARGUMENT to a sanctioned resolver call, e.g.
              resolve_vault_root(cwd, os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT"))
          which is the hooks/_lib/vault_root.py contract: the env var is the
          FALLBACK, behind detection, never the primary signal;
      (3) it carries an explicit `# vault-root-ok: <reason>` exemption comment
          on the read's own line, the line above, or any line of a multi-line
          call. An empty reason is itself a violation -- an exemption with no
          argument is a rubber stamp.

    The sanctioned patterns differ by surface, and the difference matters:
      - A SCRIPT serves one vault, so `_resolve_vault_root()` prefers the
        script's own location and ignores a mismatched env var (aggregate-*.py).
      - A HOOK fires on files in ANY vault, so it must resolve PER FILE, from
        the target path, with the env var only as fallback
        (validate-handoff-frontmatter.py's vault_root_for). A hook is the
        higher-severity surface: a wrong root makes it fail silently OPEN.

WHY AST AND NOT GREP
    The twin is a regex over shell. This one is over Python, and Python lets the
    banned pattern appear legitimately as DATA -- in this module's own docstring,
    in a test fixture stored as a source string, in a comment explaining the bug.
    Parsing means a string is a string: only an executable read is ever flagged,
    so the guard needs no self-exclusion list and cannot be defeated by moving a
    fixture around. Real .py fixtures under tests/ are additionally out of the
    fleet scope (scripts/ + hooks/), so both fixture styles are safe.

THE LEGACY POPULATION
    This lint landed on a tree with a large pre-existing population (see
    scripts/vault-root-read-baseline.txt). Those rows are pinned by SHA-256, the
    same ratchet scripts/check-cloud-safe-file-walkers.py uses: a pinned file
    passes only while it is byte-identical, so ANY edit forces remediation, and
    a NEW file is never pinned and fails immediately. The baseline is the
    remediation backlog, tagged by severity -- not a set of silent pardons.

Modes:
    --all           fleet scan (scripts/ + hooks/) against the ratchet [default]
    --check PATH..  audit named files/dirs, no baseline (fixtures, tests)
    --report        enumerate every violation by tag, never fail
    --self-test     load-bearing positive/negative controls

Exit: 0 clean, 1 violation, 2 usage/IO error.

ASCII-only output on purpose -- see scripts/check-utf8-stdout.py.
