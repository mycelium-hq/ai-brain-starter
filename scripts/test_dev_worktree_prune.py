"""Controls for dev-worktree-prune (MYC-587/677).

This script DELETES directories, so its controls are about what it refuses to
delete at least as much as what it reclaims. The failure being prevented is the
worktree-session-loss class: an abandoned session's uncommitted work removed
because nothing looked before removing.

  * clean + idle + commits on a remote        -> REAP
  * DIRTY                                     -> SNAPSHOT FIRST, then reap, and
                                                 the snapshot must actually
                                                 contain the file's bytes
  * commits on NO remote                      -> KEEP (never auto-removed)
  * recently touched                          -> KEEP (idle floor)
  * live .session-lock                        -> KEEP (a run is using it)
  * a PRIMARY checkout that merely has a dash -> never even a candidate
  * dry-run                                   -> removes nothing at all
