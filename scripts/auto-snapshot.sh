# auto-snapshot.sh — hourly snapshot of the personal vault to local git.
#
# What it does:
#   1. cd into the vault root
#   2. git add -A (respects .gitignore)
#   3. If anything is staged, git commit with a timestamped message
#   4. If nothing changed, exit silently (no empty commits, no log spam)
#
# Why local-only is safe:
#   The vault has a chflag-immutable pre-push hook that blocks ALL pushes.
#   Local commits stay in .git/objects/ on this laptop and never network out.
#   Combined with the pre-commit remote-scrubbing hook, there is no path
#   from auto-commit to GitHub. See .git/hooks/pre-push for the full
#   protection model.
#
# Recovery from a lost-update:
#   git -C "<vault>" log --all --oneline --diff-filter=M -- "<file>"
#   git -C "<vault>" show <commit>:"<file>" > /tmp/recovered.md
#
# Logs to: Meta/.auto-snapshot.log (one line per run)
#
# Installed as the bottom-of-stack defense against lost-update
# bugs in concurrent Claude Code sessions.
