"""Structural lint: a blocking hook must not rely on a non-zero exit under the
allow-fallback wrapper.

THE BUG CLASS THIS EXISTS FOR
    Most hooks in hooks.json are registered with a fail-open wrapper:

        <interpreter> <hook>.py 2>/dev/null || echo '{... "permissionDecision":"allow"}'

    That `||` exists so a CRASHING hook cannot wedge the tool. But it fires on
    ANY non-zero exit -- including a deliberate `sys.exit(2)` block. A hook that
    blocks by exiting 2 under this wrapper is therefore rewritten into an ALLOW:
    it is present on disk, registered in settings.json, visible in every audit,
    and structurally incapable of blocking anything.

    Caught live on validate-handoff-frontmatter.py (issue #375): registering it
    without converting it to the JSON protocol would have shipped a guard that
    looked correct and enforced nothing.

    This is the WIRED-BUT-NEUTERED sibling of ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-ACTIVATION. The
    gate-coverage invariant in ci.sh catches a test that never runs; this catches
    a guard that runs and can never say no.

THE RULE
    If a hook's registered command carries the allow-fallback wrapper, the hook
    must signal a block by PRINTING a deny decision (exit 0), never by exiting
    non-zero. Enforced by inspecting the script the command points at.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on violation, 2 on usage error.
