# A guard earns trust only by FAILING on the thing it catches, so every REFUSE
# case below is paired with a PASS case proving the guard is not simply
# always-on. Two cases are adversarial and matter more than the rest:

#   E2  --force must NOT open REFUSE_HOME. An escape hatch on this rule is
#       exactly what gets reached for in a hurry, which is why there is none.
#   E4  --rollback must stay UNGATED. A machine already damaged this way still
#       has to be able to undo it, and a guard that blocks the repair path
#       traps every user it was meant to protect.
