"""agentic_os_harness_eval.py - live-harness behavioral eval (MYC-623).

`validate_agents.py` proves the agent files are well-formed. This proves the two
claims an agentic-OS install actually SELLS hold in a REAL `claude` session:

  A. A subagent whose frontmatter says `tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]` physically
     CANNOT write, even when a session explicitly orders it to.
  B. The `paths_scoped_rules.py` PostToolUse hook's `additionalContext` REACHES
     the model on an edit, and stays silent on a non-matching path.

Both were doc-verified only (bug class VERIFICATION-CHECKS-UNITS-NOT-INTEGRATION).
MYC-3192 is what that costs: a containment claim false for the entire life of the
agent jail, hidden behind a test that could not fail.

## Three traps this eval is shaped around, each measured rather than assumed

1. PROSE, NOT TOOLS, DOES THE WORK. The obvious eval - "order the planner to write,
   assert no file" - passes VACUOUSLY: `planner.md`'s prose already says *"What you
   never do: Edit a file or run a command"*. Measured: a fixture carrying planner's
   exact prose with `Write` ADDED to `tools:` still did not write. So leg A uses two
   GENERATED fixtures with identical, write-WILLING prose and opaque names, differing
   only in the `tools:` list (names are opaque because `probe-ro`/`probe-rw` would
   leak the same intent the prose was neutralised for):

       probe-alpha   tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Write]   MUST write
       probe-beta    tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]          MUST NOT write

2. THE ORCHESTRATOR CAN WRITE THE FILE ITSELF. The outer session runs with write
   permission, so "a file appeared" alone does not implicate the subagent. Two things
   close this. (a) Delegation is ASSERTED structurally: the session runs under
   `--output-format stream-json` and an `Agent` tool_use naming the expected
   `subagent_type` must appear, else INFRA. (b) The DIFFERENTIAL excludes the rest -
   both probes receive an identical prompt, so an orchestrator writing the file would
   write in BOTH cases; probe-beta producing no file is what makes the outcome
   attributable to the subagent's tool surface.
   (Denying the orchestrator `Write` outright is NOT an option: measured, a parent
   `--disallowedTools Write` CASCADES to the subagent and overrides its declared
   `tools:`, so it would break the positive control too.)

3. A MODEL PARAPHRASE IS NOT A DEAD HOOK. Leg B asks the model to echo what it
   received, so "hook emitted nothing" and "model summarised instead of quoting" look
   identical. A STRUCTURAL pre-check runs first - the installed hook is invoked
   directly with a synthetic PostToolUse payload - so the live leg only ever
   adjudicates DELIVERY, never whether the hook works at all.

Exit codes:
  0  GREEN  both claims hold and every control behaved.
  1  RED    a claim is FALSE. The harness stopped enforcing; the talk-track is wrong.
  2  INFRA  inconclusive - no `claude` CLI, a control misbehaved, or a session never
            delegated. Never silently green: a run that proves nothing must not read
            as a pass, and the verdict artifact is rewritten so a stale GREEN cannot
            outlive it.
