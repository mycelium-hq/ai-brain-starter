test_claude_project_key.py — stdlib-only tests for hooks/_lib/claude_project_key.py.

Run: python3 tests/test_claude_project_key.py
No pytest dependency. Exits non-zero on any failure. Writes nothing.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Six call sites in this repo hand-rolled the ~/.claude/projects directory key and
no two agreed. Two of them produced a DOUBLE leading dash (`--Users-...` instead
of `-Users-...`) and therefore matched NOTHING, for any path, on any platform —
for months, with no error, because every caller reads an absent directory as
"no data yet".

That is the trap this file is built around. A resolver that matches nothing
passes any pure unit test you write against hand-typed expectations, because the
expectations are written by the same person who wrote the bug. So the load-
bearing test here is not `assert key(x) == "-Users-x"` — it is the POSITIVE
CONTROL below, which asserts the key resolves a directory that actually exists
on the machine running the test.

  A search earns trust only by matching something it should match.

# created, invert it back to a plausible cwd, and require the resolver to land on
# it. If the resolver is dead, this fails.

# Skips (does not fail) when the machine has no ~/.claude/projects — CI sandboxes
# legitimately have none. A skip is REPORTED, never silent, so a permanently
# skipped control cannot masquerade as a passing one.
