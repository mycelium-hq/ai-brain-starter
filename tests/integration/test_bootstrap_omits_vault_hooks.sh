#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Test scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py does NOT wire the vault-content hooks
# into ~/.claude/settings.json when there is no vault yet (no --vault-path).
#
# The bug (MYC-739, surfaced by the 2026-06-09 install workshop): with no
# --vault-path, normalize_path_substitutions() rewrote every "[VAULT_PATH]" to
# "$HOME", turning the three vault-content hooks
#     bash '[VAULT_PATH]/⚙️ Meta/scripts/graph-context-hook.sh'
#     bash '[VAULT_PATH]/⚙️ Meta/scripts/session-end-hook.sh'
#     bash '[VAULT_PATH]/⚙️ Meta/scripts/write-hook.sh'
# into  bash '$HOME/⚙️ Meta/scripts/*.sh'  — paths that DO NOT EXIST until the
# vault is created. They then error on every prompt / write / session-end and
# dump a "how do you want to remove these?" decision on a non-technical user.
# phase-00-install.md line ~79 already says "Bootstrap does NOT touch Hooks
# (vault-path-dependent; installed by /setup-brain proper)"; /setup-brain
# phase-05 wires these three with the REAL vault path. So at bootstrap time
# (no vault) they must simply be OMITTED.
#
# Asserts:
#   1. With NO --vault-path: settings.json contains ZERO "⚙️ Meta/scripts/"
#      references (none of the three vault-content hooks were written).
#   2. With NO --vault-path: the hooks that resolve correctly without a vault
#      (detect-closing-signal.py, which has a ~/.claude fallback) ARE still
#      wired — the omission is surgical, not a blanket skip of UserPromptSubmit.
#   3. NEGATIVE CONTROL — WITH --vault-path: all three vault-content hooks ARE
#      written, substituted to the real vault path (proves they are deferred,
#      not deleted, and that the path substitution still works).
#   4. settings.json is valid JSON after every write.
#
# Self-contained; never writes outside its tmpdir.
