# Test the bootstrap.sh end-to-end via --dry-run. Asserts:
#   1. bootstrap.sh --dry-run exits 0 (no parse errors, no early aborts)
#   2. The expected log lines appear in stdout (sub-skill loop fires for
#      each required skill, commands loop fires, verification loop fires)
#
# Catches the bug class where a new section in bootstrap.sh has a syntax
# error, an unbound variable, or a logic break that only surfaces when
# someone runs a real install. End-to-end coverage we previously didn't
# have. Same drift-prevention family as the worktree-session-close (#65),
# reconcile-ff (#68), and phase-doc-skills (#73) tests.
#
# Self-contained. Sets EMAIL/NAME/LANG_HINT env so the bootstrap doesn't
# block on the email-gate. Doesn't write outside its tmpdir.
