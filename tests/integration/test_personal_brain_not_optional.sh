# Regression test: the install must never offer a work-only / operational-only
# path. The personal brain (journaling, floor framework, advisory panel,
# insights, life reflection) installs by default for everyone.
#
# Bug class: the install detects (or the user describes) a heavily operational
# vault and the assistant improvises a global scope question -- "what do you
# want this brain *for*? that decides which phases I run" -- then skips the
# whole personal half. The skill already says "one install, every phase, no
# tiers," but it had no explicit guard against narrowing scope from a
# detected-operational vault, so the improvisation leaked.
#
# Source incident: a real /setup-brain run on an all-operational vault. The
# assistant asked the user to pick a scope ("solo operación") and skipped
# journaling, the panel, health, and books. The personal brain is the gift,
# not an add-on -- it must arrive as the default design, never as a removed
# option or a bug.
#
# This test fails if the scope guard is removed from SKILL.md or
# phase-01-welcome.md, or if the existing "no tiers" guard regresses.
#
# Self-contained. Exit 0 = pass. Exit 1 = fail with details.
