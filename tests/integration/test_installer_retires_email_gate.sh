#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Test scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py retires a removed hook from an
# EXISTING user's settings.json. This is the propagation step that actually
# un-nags people who installed before the every-session email gate was
# deleted: merge_hooks() never removes a hook gone from the template, so
# without retire_stale_hooks() the dead hook stays wired forever.
#
# Asserts:
#   1. A wired email-gate-hook.py is REMOVED on install ("1 stale hook(s)").
#   2. The replacement post-update-email-ask.py is ADDED from the template.
#   3. A SIBLING ai-brain-starter hook + the user's OWN custom hook survive
#      (negative control: retire is surgical, not a blanket wipe).
#   4. Idempotent: a second run removes 0 and does not duplicate the new hook.
#   5. No false retire: a settings.json with no retired hook removes 0.
#
# Self-contained; never writes outside its tmpdir.
