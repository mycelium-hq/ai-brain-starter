# Test: surface-stale-automation-failures.py -- launchd HOLLOW-job detection.
#
# Bug class: `launchctl list` column 2 (the last exit status) reads "0" for
# BOTH a genuinely healthy job (ran, exited clean) AND a job launchd has
# REGISTERED but has NEVER EXECUTED. Measured 2026-08-20 on a real install:
#
#     launchctl list        ->  -   0   <label>      # reads as CLEAN
#     launchctl print ...   ->  state = not running | runs = 0 | last exit code = (never exited)
#
# The pre-fix `launchd_failures()` read ONLY `launchctl list`, so a hollow job
# was indistinguishable from a healthy one and was never flagged -- a real job
# sat dead, unnoticed, for days behind exactly this blind spot. The fix adds a
# second, slower probe (`launchctl print gui/<uid>/<label>`) for the AMBIGUOUS
# status==0 case only, and reports a hollow job as a finding DISTINCT from a
# failing one, because the remedy differs: bootout+bootstrap (reload it) vs.
# reading the error log.
#
# `launchctl` is stubbed on PATH -- the real binary is never touched, and this
# suite must never load/bootstrap/kickstart/unload any real launchd job. One
# stub handles both subcommands the hook calls:
#   `launchctl list`                    -> a fixed PID/status/label table
#   `launchctl print gui/<uid>/<label>` -> per-label canned output, branching
#                                          on the label suffix so the uid
#                                          launchd_failures() computes at
#                                          runtime never has to be known here
# Same PATH-stub convention as test_hook_vault_root_per_target.sh case 8.
#
# Assertions:
#   1. PRE-FIX PROOF (the negative control that proves the fix). An
#      independent, literal reimplementation of the OLD decision rule --
#      "read only the `list` status column; flag iff it parses as a non-zero
#      int" -- applied to the SAME raw `launchctl list` stub rows, does NOT
#      flag the hollow-job label. This is deliberately NOT a diff against git
#      history: after this fix lands on main, "before" and "after" would be
#      the same file and a history-based comparison would stop proving
#      anything. A frozen, independent reimplementation keeps meaning the
#      same thing forever.
#   2-5. END-TO-END, one real hook invocation, four labels in one fixture:
#      2. hollow job      (list status 0, print runs=0)     -> flagged, distinctly
#      3. failing job     (list status 9)                   -> still flagged (no regression)
#      4. healthy job     (list status 0, print runs=42)    -> NOT flagged (no false positive)
#      5. flaky-print job (list status 0, print errors out) -> NOT flagged, hook does not crash
#
# Self-contained. Exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = fail.
