# Test the user-space Node + Python fallback in bootstrap.sh (MYC-3895).
#
# Bug (2026-08-12 cohort install session): on a corporate laptop with no admin
# rights there is no brew and no sudo. bootstrap.sh's only path was
# `brew install python@3.12 || err "..."` / `brew install node || err "..."` —
# both HARD-failed, and the install never recovered. Mirrors bootstrap.ps1's
# Node ZIP fallback: fetch an official, relocatable tarball into a user-owned
# prefix (~/.local/node, ~/.local/python), no elevation anywhere.
#
# Covered here:
#   1. bootstrap.sh is syntactically valid (bash -n).
#   2. have_sudo() answers "can I elevate WITHOUT a password prompt right now"
#      — false when sudo -n fails (the non-interactive case this whole bug is
#      about), true when it succeeds. Both directions, so a stub that always
#      returns true could not pass this silently.
#   3. add_user_path_entry() is idempotent: exporting PATH for this session AND
#      persisting to the user's shell rc file, without duplicating the line on
#      a second call.
#   4. MAIN SCENARIO: brew ABSENT, no sudo -> the real Python + Node sections of
#      bootstrap.sh (extracted verbatim, not reimplemented) land a WORKING
#      node and python3 in user space, PATH is wired, and err() is NEVER
#      called (asserted via a FAILED-array count, not string absence alone).
#   5. NEGATIVE CONTROL for 4: run the identical harness against the pre-fix
#      bootstrap.sh (git show origin/main:bootstrap.sh) and assert it DOES
#      call err() twice and DOES NOT land a working node (proves the harness
#      would have caught the bug it exists to catch, not just exercised dead
#      code). Skipped gracefully when origin/main is unavailable (no network).
#   6. Linux wiring: both sections gate their admin path on `is_linux &&
#      have_sudo`, and fall back to the same install_*_userspace() functions
#      structurally (not behaviorally re-simulated on this runner — 4 already
#      proves the functions themselves work; this proves Linux reaches them).
#
# Functions are extracted from the real bootstrap.sh with awk (never
# reimplemented), so this can't silently drift from the shipped source — same
# technique as test_bootstrap_archive_entry.sh's have_working_git/
# adopt_archive_install extraction. uname is stubbed to force darwin/arm64
# regardless of the actual test-runner OS (CI runs this suite on Linux — see
# test_bootstrap_brew_terminal_step.sh — so the Mac branch must be reachable
# deterministically, not conditionally skipped there).
#
# Self-contained; no network (curl is stubbed to serve local fixture
# tarballs); never writes outside its own sandboxed HOME.

# ── 5. NEGATIVE CONTROL: the identical harness against the PRE-FIX source
# must fail the way the bug actually failed (err() called, node absent) —
# proving check 4 exercises real logic, not a tautology.
#
# THE "BEFORE" SOURCE IS A FROZEN FIXTURE, NEVER A MOVING REF.
#
# This check used to read it with `git show origin/main:bootstrap.sh`. That was
# true exactly once: while the fix sat on a feature branch and origin/main still
# held the pre-fix code. The moment #502 merged, origin/main:bootstrap.sh BECAME
# the fixed code, so the control ran the fix against itself, observed success
# where it demands failure, and went red — on main, on every commit after it, for
# four commits, blocking every push and every merge in the repo.
#
# The shape is worth naming, because it is invisible in review: a control whose
# "before" is a moving ref is GUARANTEED to pass in the PR that introduces it and
# GUARANTEED to fail forever once that PR lands. It cannot be caught by running
# it; it can only be caught by reading it, or by the identity assertion below.
#
# A pinned SHA would fix the mutability but not the reachability: the `ci` job's
# checkout takes no fetch-depth, so it is shallow, and an old SHA is simply not
# in the object store there. Hence a vendored fixture — a snapshot of history,
# correct forever, immune to ref movement, history rewrites and clone depth.
#
# That same shallowness is why this survived four commits, and it is the
# strongest argument for the fixture. `origin/main` does not resolve in the
# shallow `ci` job either, so on every PR the old code took its `else` branch,
# printed "SKIP: 5 (negative control) — origin/main not resolvable here", and
# reported PASS. The control had therefore NEVER run in a gating context since
# it was written: green on every PR, red only on push-to-main, where origin/main
# finally resolves and it compares the fix against itself. A required check that
# can only fail AFTER the merge blocks nothing. That SKIP branch is gone for
# exactly this reason — an unresolvable "before" source now fails loud, because
# a control that cannot run must not report success.
#
# The fixture also makes PR and main SYMMETRIC: a vendored file resolves the
# same way in a shallow checkout and a full one, so this control now runs where
# it can still stop something.
#
# The fixture is named .sh.txt, not .sh, deliberately: it is frozen DATA, never
# executed, and scripts/shellcheck.sh lints every tracked *.sh. A historical
# snapshot must not be edited to satisfy a linter.

#
# The likelier regression is subtler and the byte check is blind to it: a future
# maintainer sees a fixture that looks stale next to bootstrap.sh and
# "refreshes" it by re-running the extraction against CURRENT source. That
# produces a ~70-line extract of POST-fix code, which is not byte-equal to

# person to debug the wrong file. This repo has already paid for a
# wrong-repair-pointer once (6ac8364).
