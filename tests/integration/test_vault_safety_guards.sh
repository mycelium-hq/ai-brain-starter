# Run the vault-safety guard self-tests in CI so they cannot bit-rot.
#
# These guards each ship a negative control (they assert the guard FIRES on the
# thing it catches AND stays silent otherwise) — but a self-test that only ever
# runs by hand is one refactor away from silently going stale. Wiring them into
# the canonical `scripts/ci.sh` gate is what makes "a guard earns trust only by
# failing on the thing it catches" durable instead of aspirational.
#
# Covers:
#   - scripts/test-cloud-sync-guard.sh           (vault-in-cloud-sync detector, #159)
#   - scripts/test-sync-folder-machinery-guard.sh (machinery-in-synced-folder + Drive Mirror roots, MYC-705)
#   - scripts/test-vault-backup-guard.sh         (no-off-machine-backup detector)
#   - scripts/test-vault-backup-roundtrip.sh     (one-command backup: real restore loop)
#
# CI-safe: every guard test is hermetic (temp dirs, isolated config via env),
# needs no network, and the round-trip test skips its encrypted leg when neither
# gpg nor openssl is present.
