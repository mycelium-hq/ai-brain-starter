# Regression test for inject-meeting-workflow-on-trigger.py
#
# Bug class: ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-AUTOMATION-WIRING. The meeting-workflow.md
# rule existed in the vault and README/POWER_TOOLS.md promised the
# "I just had a meeting" cascade fired automatically — but no
# UserPromptSubmit hook surfaced the rule on the trigger phrase. Users
# reported saying "I just had a meeting" and getting nothing back.
#
# This test asserts:
#   1. The hook is present in hooks/.
#   2. It is wired into hooks.json under UserPromptSubmit.
#   3. EN trigger phrases fire ("I just had a meeting", variants).
#   4. ES trigger phrases fire ("acabo de tener una reunión", variants).
#   5. Non-trigger meeting mentions do NOT fire (future / past-week /
#      planning / asking about a meeting — temporal-anchor discipline).
#   6. The injected payload references meeting-workflow.md so the
#      assistant actually has the cascade in context.
#   7. The bypass env var suppresses the injection.
#
# Self-contained. Exit 0 = pass. Exit 1 = fail with details.
