# Test the zero-prerequisite entry path: bootstrap.sh must survive being run
# from a directory that holds this repo's files but has no .git.
#
# Bug (MYC-3895, 2026-08-12 cohort install session): the install's FIRST
# command was `git clone`, and git was the one prerequisite neither bootstrap
# installed. Corporate laptops block the CLI installers that provide it — the
# session transcript records it verbatim: "Git and Node.js CLI installs require
# administrator rights." Five participants ended the session still blocked. Every
# no-admin recovery path further down bootstrap.sh was unreachable, because the
# fetch that lands bootstrap.sh itself ran first and needed git.
#
# Fix: the entry command falls back to a tarball/zip (curl+tar, Invoke-WebRequest
# +Expand-Archive) which need no git, no brew and no admin. That means bootstrap
# can now start in a directory with no .git, where a plain `git clone` FAILS
# (non-empty target) and used to land in the red actionable-failures list —
# trading a missing-git block for a scary-looking one. adopt_archive_install()
# converts that directory into a real clone so auto-update keeps working.
#
# Covered here:
#   1. bootstrap.sh is syntactically valid (bash -n).
#   2. have_working_git probes by EXECUTION, not presence — macOS ships a
#      /usr/bin/git stub with the Command Line Tools absent, so `command -v git`
#      succeeds on a machine where git cannot clone anything.
#   3. adopt_archive_install turns a clean archive dir into a real clone tracking
#      origin/main, and leaves NO backup behind.
#   4. Negative control for 3: an archive dir with a local edit is NOT silently
#      reset — a .bak-<stamp> copy is made and its path recorded.
#   5. adopt_archive_install RETURNS NON-ZERO when it cannot reach the remote, so
#      the caller's non-fatal warn path is real rather than assumed.
#   6. Ordering: the archive-adopt branch comes BEFORE the bare `git clone` else
#      branch, so a non-empty directory can never reach the failing clone.
#
# Self-contained; no network; never writes outside its tmpdir.
