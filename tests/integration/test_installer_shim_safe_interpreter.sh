# CI lock: the installer bakes a shim-safe ABSOLUTE interpreter into hook
# commands, so a refuse-shim can't turn the vault's bare-python3 hooks into
# silent no-ops.
#
# The trailofbits `modern-python` plugin prepends a PATH shim for
# `python3`/`python` (SessionStart, via CLAUDE_ENV_FILE) that prints
# "ERROR: use uv run python3" and exit-1s on every bare invocation. Every
# ai-brain-starter hook command used to call bare `python3 X 2>/dev/null ||
# echo ...`, so with the shim active the ENTIRE hook layer — session close, the
# write-time secret guard, context loaders, aggregators — silently no-opped.
# hooks.json now uses a [PYTHON] token that install-hooks-user-level.py resolves
# to an absolute real interpreter (_posix_python), bypassing PATH entirely.
#
# Asserts, by running the REAL installer with a fake refuse-shim FIRST on PATH:
#   0. NEGATIVE CONTROL: bare `python3` under that PATH genuinely refuses.
#   1. NO ABS-owned hook command invokes bare `python3`/`python`.
#   2. The baked interpreter is absolute and is NOT the shim.
#   3. END-TO-END: that interpreter executes under the hostile PATH.
#
# Stdlib python3 + bash only. No network, no git. Tmpdir removed on exit.
