# Test: detect-closing-signal.py resolves session-artifact paths against the
# repo a session is actually working in, even when a DIFFERENT vault is
# configured as the machine-wide VAULT_ROOT default.
#
# Bug class: VAULT_ROOT is commonly set once, globally, in Claude Code's
# settings.json `env` block (so every hook subprocess always sees it set).
# The hook's old resolution was `os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT") or cwd` — once
# VAULT_ROOT is set globally, the `or cwd` branch is DEAD, permanently, for
# every session on the machine. A session working inside a SEPARATE
# vault-shaped repo (its own CLAUDE.md declaring its own "Session End" /
# "Session Close" cascade, its own Sessions/Decisions folders) had its
# session file, decisions dir, and captures file silently resolved against
# the unrelated default vault instead of the repo it was actually in.
#
# Reproduced 2026-06-30 against a real mycelium-vault-rooted session: the
# injected SESSION CLOSE context resolved every path under the personal
# vault (the global VAULT_ROOT default) despite cwd being entirely inside a
# separate repo with its own Session End cascade.
#
# Assertions:
#   1. NEGATIVE CONTROL — cwd inside a repo-vault, VAULT_ROOT set to a
#      DIFFERENT default vault: resolves to the repo-vault, NOT the default.
#      (This is the case that reproduced the bug: without the fix, this
#      assertion fails and meta_dir/session_file land under DEFAULT_VAULT.)
#   2. Same, fired from inside a WORKTREE of the repo-vault: still resolves
#      to the repo-vault's MAIN root (combines with the worktree-collapse
#      invariant — never the worktree, never the default vault).
#   3. Heading match is case-insensitive ("Session end", lowercase "end",
#      as used by at least one real confirmed second case).
#   4. FALLBACK PRESERVED — cwd in an untracked location (no CLAUDE.md
#      anywhere in its ancestry): still resolves to VAULT_ROOT (today's
#      default/fallback behavior, unchanged).
#   5. FALLBACK PRESERVED — cwd inside the default vault itself, whose
#      CLAUDE.md uses a heading that does NOT declare a Session End/Close
#      cascade (e.g. "Session Protocol", the personal vault's real
#      heading): still resolves via the VAULT_ROOT/cwd fallback, not a
#      false walk-up match.
#
# Self-contained: tmpdir fake vaults, HOME redirected so the marker file
# never touches the real ~/.claude and so the walk-up's $HOME boundary is
# deterministic. Exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail with detail on stderr.
