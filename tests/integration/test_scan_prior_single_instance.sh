# Test: scan-prior-sessions-for-secrets.py — the single-instance / no-pile-up
# regression for the 2026-06-05 freeze.
#
# Bug class (PRE-fix): the hook stamped its 6h cooldown marker AFTER the slow
# corpus scan. So every session that started DURING the scan window saw no
# fresh marker and launched its OWN full scan. N concurrent multi-minute scans
# pegged the CPU until the machine froze (load 36). There was no single-instance
# lock, no incremental baseline, no wall-clock budget.
#
# The fix this test guards: a flock single-instance lock + stamp-at-START. A
# second concurrent invocation must back off IMMEDIATELY instead of starting a
# second corpus scan — that is what "a fresh install on a multi-session machine
# cannot pile up a corpus scan" means.
#
# Hermetic: the hook + its _lib are copied into a temp dir, so HOOK_DIR (and
# therefore the lock + markers) live in the temp dir. HOME is pointed at the
# temp dir too, so the scanned corpus is a tiny fixture we control. Nothing
# touches the real ~/.claude or the repo working tree.
#
# Assertions:
#   POSITIVE control (lock free):
#     1. A free run completes, emits valid continue JSON, and PRIMES the
#        incremental baseline (writes .last-secret-scan-full).
#   NEGATIVE control / the regression (lock held by a concurrent "scan"):
#     2. With the lock held, a second invocation backs off: it does NOT
#        re-create the full-pass marker (it never reached the scan), and it
#        still emits valid continue JSON. This is the no-pile-up guarantee.
#
# Exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = fail.
