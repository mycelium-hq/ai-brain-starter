# Negative-control gate for scripts/check-hookify-template-capabilities.py.
#
# That gate exists because the OFFICIAL hookify engine silently returns False for
# an operator it does not implement and None for a field it cannot resolve: a
# template using a capability the official engine lacks LOADS FINE AND NEVER
# FIRES. A safety rule that never fires reads as protection that is not there.
#
# A guard earns trust only by failing on the thing it catches, so this proves:
#   1. GREEN on the real shipped templates (never ship a known-red gate).
#   2. RED on an unsupported operator in a non-allowlisted template.
#   3. RED on an unsupported field for the template's event.
#   4. RED on a STALE allowlist entry (the debt ledger self-cleans when the
#      upstream fix lands and the violation disappears).
#   5. GREEN for an allowlisted template that still violates (fix in flight).
#
# Stdlib python3 + bash only (no PyYAML, no network, no git). Tmpdir on exit.
# Run: bash tests/integration/test_hookify_template_capabilities.sh  (0 = pass)
