# test_dry_run_purity.sh — a dry run must NEVER mutate the machine.
#
# WHY: a real user ran `bash bootstrap.sh --dry-run` as a "safe preview" and
# Homebrew, Node, gh, pipx, and graphify were ACTUALLY INSTALLED — the
# Homebrew branch even documented it ("or dry-run: install for real"). Their
# assistant then (correctly) warned them not to trust --dry-run at all. This
# gate makes that class of regression impossible to reintroduce silently.
#
# Two layers:
#   T1  BEHAVIORAL: run the real bootstrap.sh --dry-run in a hermetic sandbox
#       (fake HOME + recording stubs for every mutating command). Any stub
#       invocation of a mutating subcommand lands in a violations file. The
#       run must exit 0 with ZERO violations and print [dry-run] preview lines.
#   T2  STRUCTURAL: the behavioral layer can't reach install branches (the
#       stubs make every tool look "already installed"), so separately assert
#       each known install command in bootstrap.sh sits inside a section that
#       checks DRY_RUN first.
#
# Run: bash tests/integration/test_dry_run_purity.sh  (0 = pass, 1 = fail)
