# Dogfoods the REAL shipped hooks.json through the installer's --fail-on-missing
# verifier on a faithfully-reconstructed HEALTHY vault install (MYC-2558 follow-up).
#
# Why this exists on top of test_verify_fallback_chain_optional.sh: that test
# proves the classification LOGIC on a synthetic one-command hooks.json. It would
# NOT catch a false-positive introduced by some OTHER hook's command shape — the
# exact blind spot behind MYC-2558, where a healthy macOS/Linux vault install
# nagged "the hook re-install didn't finish cleanly" every ~6-day cycle. This
# test asserts the property against the ACTUAL artifact clients install, so any
# future hooks.json change that reintroduces the recurring-warning class fails CI.
#
# Faithful healthy-install state:
#   - ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/... home copies present (every install has these)
#   - vault-content hooks under <vault>/⚙️ Meta/scripts/... present (phase-05 wires them)
#   - the skill repo is NOT cloned into <vault>/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/, so the
#     vault-side copy of the ||-fallback hook is ABSENT — only the home copy backs it.
#
# Asserts:
#   (a) that healthy install -> `--fail-on-missing` exits 0.
#   (b) NEGATIVE CONTROL: delete one genuinely-required home hook -> exits 1.
#
# The installer's OWN path extractor enumerates what to create, so the test can
# never drift from however the installer parses commands. Self-contained; exit 0 = pass.
