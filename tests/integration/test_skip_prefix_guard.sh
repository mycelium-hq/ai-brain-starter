# Integration test: block-skip-prefix-in-vault-write.py
#
# The guard blocks a life-record vault write that still carries a literal
# `__SKIP` line -- content the user told the assistant NOT to persist. A
# persisted line cannot be un-persisted (it is in the file, in git history, and
# in any index that reads the vault), so this fails closed.
#
# EVERY assertion has a negative control. A guard that blocks everything and a
# guard that blocks the right thing produce the same PASS on a block-only
# suite; the allow cases are what tell them apart.
#
# Pure string-level: the hook matches path strings from the payload, so no real
# vault, files, or git are needed -- fast and hermetic.
