# Regression test for inject-meeting-workflow-on-trigger.py truncation flag.
#
# Bug: when the customized meeting-workflow.md exceeds MAX_RULE_CHARS,
# the hook used to append `...[truncated — read full file at <path>]`
# at the END of the injected content. The header before it said "Run
# the FULL cascade below" — so the model started executing the cascade
# against the truncated first 8K chars without knowing late steps
# (Decision Log, CRM updates, humanizer pass, backlinks verify, final
# report) had been dropped. The model would either skip those steps or
# only notice the truncation marker AFTER it had already taken irreversible
# actions like writing a partial meeting note.
#
# This test asserts:
#   1. Cap is now 16000 (raised from 8000).
#   2. Below-cap rules inject normally (no TRUNCATED flag).
#   3. Above-cap rules get a prominent TRUNCATED flag at the TOP of
#      additionalContext, BEFORE the cascade-instruction.
#   4. The TRUNCATED flag names the rule-file path and tells the model
#      to read the full file before running.
#   5. The truncation flag warns about the silent-drop categories
#      (late steps) explicitly so the model knows what's at risk.
#   6. The end-of-content tail still has a remainder-omitted marker
#      (defense in depth — if the model reads only the bottom, it
#      still knows truncation happened).
