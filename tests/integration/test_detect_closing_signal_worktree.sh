# Test: detect-closing-signal.py resolves session-artifact paths to the MAIN
# vault, even when the close cascade fires from inside a worktree.
#
# Bug class: the UserPromptSubmit hook set vault_root from its own cwd. Fired
# inside <vault>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>/, cwd IS the worktree, so the
# session file, decisions dir, captures and time-tracking all resolved
# worktree-side. When the worktree was archived those writes were discarded
# as "uncommitted changes" — session history silently lost.
#
# Same bug class as issue #65 (tests/integration/test_worktree_session_close.sh)
# but for the UserPromptSubmit hook, not the Stop hook. PR #66 fixed the Stop
# hook; this hook (Layer 1 of the cascade) was never brought to parity.
#
# Assertions:
#   1. Fired from a worktree cwd, the resolved meta_dir is the MAIN vault's.
#   2. The session file resolves under the MAIN vault, never .claude/worktrees/.
#   3. The pre-built session shell is physically written to the MAIN vault.
#   4. The worktree slug is still preserved in the session filename.
#   5. Fired from a normal (non-worktree) cwd, paths resolve unchanged.
#
# Self-contained: tmpdir fake vault, HOME redirected so the marker file never
# touches the real ~/.claude. Exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail with detail on stderr.
