#!/usr/bin/env bash
# CI lock + negative control for the client-side deployed==committed hook drift
# surfacer (MYC-2507, hooks/surface-deployed-hooks-behind.py).
#
# WHY: "a guard earns trust only by failing on the thing it catches" (fail-loud-
# not-silent-noop). The auto-update's deploy step (install-hooks-user-level.py)
# fails OPEN: on a silent failure the checkout is current but ~/.claude/settings.json
# falls behind hooks.json, and the client gets ZERO signal. This surfacer closes
# that gap; this test proves it fires on a stale deploy and stays silent on a
# healthy one — both directions.
#
# Asserts:
#   1. NEG-CONTROL: the detector is SILENT on exactly what the REAL installer
#      produces from the REAL hooks.json (ties detection to the deploy's real
#      output — no cry-wolf, and no drift between "committed" and "deployed").
#   2. MISSING: a committed ABS hook removed from settings.json -> FIRES, names it,
#      gives the one-command fix.
#   3. RETIRED: a retired hook still wired in settings.json -> FIRES, names it.
#   4. FAIL-OPEN: missing settings.json / missing hooks.json -> SILENT (never crash).
#   5. VAULT-EXCLUSION (the key false-positive guard): a committed VAULT hook
#      absent from a no-vault deploy -> SILENT (the deploy never wires vault hooks;
#      /setup-brain does). A non-vault hook missing in the same fixture -> FIRES,
#      and it must NOT name the vault hook.
#
# Stdlib python3 + bash only. No network, no git. Tmpdir removed on exit.
