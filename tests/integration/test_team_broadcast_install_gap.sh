# Regression test for team_broadcast_install_gap() in
# hooks/surface-stale-automation-failures.py.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: team_broadcast_findings() infers health from a log file
# (~/.claude/logs/team-broadcast-daily.log). A machine where team-broadcast was
# NEVER installed has no log file for the same reason a HEALTHY, quiet install
# has no log file yet: nothing has run. Both read as team_broadcast_findings()
# returning [] -- so "never installed" produced zero signal, on every session,
# indefinitely. That is a stricter silence than an outright failure would have
# been. team_broadcast_install_gap() checks installation directly (script
# presence, then the launchd job) instead of inferring it from a log.
#
# THE LABEL IS MATCHED BY SUFFIX, NEVER BY A LITERAL NAMESPACE. The job is
# `com.<operator>.team-broadcast-daily`, and the `<operator>` half is chosen by
# whoever installed it. A hardcoded reverse-DNS prefix would query a label that
# exists on exactly one machine and report "not registered" forever to every
# other operator who HAS installed it. Cases 3 and 4 are the control for that:
# two DIFFERENT fictional namespaces must both read as installed.
#
# Asserts, in order:
#   0. DEFAULT INSTALL: never set up here -> SILENT. This substrate ships no
#      team-broadcast skill, so a missing auto-send.py is the NORMAL state and
#      nagging about it would train every operator to ignore this watchdog.
#   1. OPTED-IN BUT BROKEN: set up here, script gone -> FIRES, names the path.
#   2. CRON-GAP: script present, no *.team-broadcast-daily job -> FIRES, names
#      the suffix it looked for, and does NOT claim session-close broadcasts (a
#      separate, live-invoked path) are affected.
#   3. NEG-CONTROL: script present, job registered under one namespace -> SILENT.
#   4. ANY-OPERATOR: same, under a completely different namespace -> SILENT.
#      Case 3 alone would still pass if the suffix match were secretly a literal.
#   4b. HOLLOW: registered but runs=0 -> FIRES. `launchctl list` shows status 0
#      for a job that never ran, identical to a healthy one, and the generic
#      launchd pass skips this label by suffix — so only this finder can see it.
#   5. END-TO-END: the finding reaches the real SessionStart entrypoint
#      (main()'s systemMessage), not just the helper function in isolation.
#
# launchctl is macOS-only; CI runs ubuntu (CONTRIBUTING.md). A fake launchctl on
# PATH makes cases 2-5 deterministic on any OS instead of skipping Linux CI.
# Stdlib python3 + bash only. No network, no real launchd/git. Tmpdir on exit.
#
# THE HOOK READS HOST STATE THROUGH THREE CHANNELS, AND ALL THREE ARE PINNED
# HERE. HOME (run_sandboxed) and launchctl (fake_launchctl) are the obvious two.
# The third is the VAULT: main() resolves one and hands it to runners() and
# receipts_reconcile_findings(), which read `<vault>/⚙️ Meta/...`. Nothing about
# the HOME sandbox constrains that resolution — vault_root_for() walks up from
# the payload's `cwd` and otherwise falls back to $VAULT_ROOT, an env var
# routinely exported machine-wide. Left inherited, it aimed the hook at the
# DEVELOPER'S OWN vault and the three "-> SILENT" cases below failed on that
# operator's real receipts-reconcile findings — a red that says nothing about
# team-broadcast. See newhome() and run_hook() for the pinning.
