# Fresh-install smoke for the anti-fabrication guard family (MYC-1017).
#
# The bug this closes is ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-ACTIVATION: the guards shipped into
# the repo as FILES for months while `scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py` never
# registered them, so every install got the files and none got the behavior.
# File presence is therefore NOT the assertion — registration in the installed
# settings.json is, plus proof the registered command actually executes.
#
# Asserts, by running the REAL installer against a sandboxed HOME:
#   0. NEGATIVE CONTROL: a pre-install settings.json has NONE of the guards.
#   1. check-fabricated-verification.py registered on Stop.
#   2. check-fabricated-hook-attribution.py registered on Stop.
#   3. warn-chained-state-command-truncated.py registered on PreToolUse.
#   4. Every registered guard script EXISTS at the path the command names.
#   5. END-TO-END: the registered Stop command, run verbatim on a transcript
#      that reproduces the incident, BLOCKS.  <- activation actually works
#   6. END-TO-END negative control: the same command on an honest transcript
#      does NOT block.  <- no false positive on the shipped wiring
#   7. Idempotent: a second install does not duplicate the entries.
#
# Stdlib python3 + bash only. No network, no git. Tmpdir removed on exit.
