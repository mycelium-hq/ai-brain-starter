# Fresh-install smoke for block-env-dump.py (MYC-4988).
#
# The bug class this closes is ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-ACTIVATION: a guard shipped as
# a FILE but never registered by scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py gets
# copied to every install and protects none of them. File presence is
# therefore NOT the assertion -- registration in the installed settings.json
# is, plus proof the registered command actually BLOCKS a seeded env-dump
# command.
#
# Asserts, by running the REAL installer against a sandboxed HOME:
#   0. NEGATIVE CONTROL: a pre-install settings.json does not have the guard.
#   1. The guard is registered on PreToolUse after install.
#   2. The registered script EXISTS at the path the command names.
#   3. The command uses the `if [ -f ]` form, NOT `2>/dev/null || echo <allow>`.
#      A blocking hook wired the second way has its stderr discarded and its
#      exit-2 converted into an allow -- registered, running, and inert.
#   4. END-TO-END: the registered command, run verbatim against a seeded
#      `env` dump, BLOCKS (rc=2).                  <- activation actually works
#   5. END-TO-END negative control: the same command against a clean Bash
#      payload does NOT block (rc=0).               <- no false block
#   6. Idempotent: a second install does not duplicate the entry.
#
# Stdlib python3 + bash. No network. Tmpdir removed on exit.
