# The guard exists to red-flag a test that escapes its sandbox and writes into
# the real ~/.claude. It watches deployed CODE. It must NOT react to the logs,
# lock files and append-only state that ordinary session machinery writes into
# those same directories continuously — reacting to those produced a RED the
# harness could not support (MYC-3507).
#
# Both directions are asserted. A fingerprint that ignores everything is as
# useless as one that fires on everything, so every "must not react" case is
# paired with a "must still react" case.
#
# Tests the REAL function, extracted from ci.sh rather than reimplemented, so
