# Test: surface-stranded-session-artifacts.py — SessionStart watchdog that
# detects session artifacts left UNCOMMITTED inside a worktree.
#
# Bug class: when the close cascade wrote a session file / Decisions / Time
# Tracking into a worktree's own checkout, those writes sat uncommitted and
# were discarded when the worktree was archived ("N uncommitted changes that
# will be permanently discarded"). detect-closing-signal.py now resolves
# close-cascade writes to the main vault; this watchdog is the Layer 3 canary
# that surfaces anything that still slips through, at the NEXT session start.
#
# Complements surface-orphan-claude-branches.py: that hook catches the
# committed-but-unmerged half (commits on claude/* branches); this hook
# catches the uncommitted half (changes in a worktree working dir).
#
# Assertions:
#   1. Silent when every worktree is clean.
#   2. Detects an uncommitted session file in a worktree, names that worktree.
#   3. Does not flag a clean worktree.
#   4. Does not flag a session artifact once it is committed (that is the
#      sibling hook's job — this one is uncommitted-only).
#
# Self-contained: tmpdir fake vault + real git worktrees. Exit 0 = pass.
