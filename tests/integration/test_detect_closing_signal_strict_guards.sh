# Test: detect-closing-signal.py strict_guards suppress all tiers (including
# explicit + high_confidence + custom) for unambiguous non-close contexts.
#
# Bug class: high_confidence regex `\b(let'?s\s+)?close\s+(this|the|out|up)\s+session\b`
# matched meta-discussion of the close cascade itself ("fix close-session regex",
# "why does session keep firing", "let me close the database session"). The
# 2026-05-12 fix made strong tiers override false_positive_guards (so legit
# "okay, let's close this session" wouldn't be suppressed by the "okay let's"
# transition guard) — but that broke meta-discussion suppression entirely. 139
# empty session stubs accumulated vault-wide before the strict_guards tier was
# added.
#
# Assertions:
#   META-DISCUSSION (should NOT fire):
#     1. "why do my sessions keep auto archiving? please diagnose and fix"
#     2. "fix the close-this-session regex"
#     3. "debug why close this session keeps firing"
#     4. "the regex pattern is `close this session` and it fires too much"
#     5. "let me close out the database session"
#     6. "sessions keep getting auto-archived"
#     7. "sessions keep firing the cascade"
#   LEGITIMATE CLOSES (should still fire — strict guards must NOT over-suppress):
#     8. "bye for now"
#     9. "good night"
#    10. "let's close this session"
#    11. "wrap it up"
#    12. "thanks that's all"
#    13. "okay let's close this session" (2026-05-12 regression case)
#   INTERROGATIVE meta-questions ABOUT a close (should NOT fire — added
#   2026-06-30 after "did you close this session?" fired the full cascade):
#    14. "did you close this session?"   (the reported false-positive)
#    15. "have you closed the session?"
#    16. "is the session closed?"
#   MODAL-REQUEST close phrased as a question (should STILL fire — the
#   negative control proving the interrogative guard discriminates a
#   question ABOUT closing from a request TO close):
#    17. "can you close this session?"
#
# Self-contained: tmpdir fake vault, HOME redirected. Exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail.
