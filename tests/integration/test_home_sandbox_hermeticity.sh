# Static guard: a test that redirects HOME must redirect USERPROFILE with it.
#
# THE BUG THIS LOCKS OUT (MYC-3536)
#
# Tests sandbox HOME so the developer's real ~/.claude is never touched. On POSIX
# that works. On Windows it does not: Python resolves "~" through
# ntpath.expanduser, which reads USERPROFILE and ignores HOME entirely. So a test
# that sets only HOME looks sandboxed, passes review, and runs against the real
# ~/.claude on every Windows machine.
#
# It did. On 2026-07-30 the suite rewrote the real ~/.claude/settings.json,
# repointing 95 of 111 hook entries at hook_runner.py inside the throwaway git
# worktree the tests happened to run from. Deleting that worktree left every hook
# launching a file that no longer existed; CPython exits 2 for "can't open file",
# and exit 2 is Claude Code's intentional-BLOCK signal — so every tool call in
# later, unrelated sessions was denied, with nothing tying the failure back to
# the test run. Same fail-closed class as #375 and #409.
#
# SCOPE — three things the first version of this guard got wrong, all found by
# probing it rather than reading it:
#   1. It compared per FILE, not per SITE: a file that sandboxed three call sites
#      and leaked a fourth passed, because USERPROFILE appeared *somewhere*.
#      Pairing is now checked in a window around each HOME site.
#   2. It scanned only tests/integration/*.sh. Python suites set HOME too —
#      services/health-mcp/tests/test_shortcut_bridge.py redirects HOME so
#      db_path() (which reads Path.home()) lands in a tmpdir, which on Windows
#      means it read and wrote the developer's REAL health database.
#   3. Its own negative control only proved the detector fired, never that a
#      correctly-paired site was left alone.
#   4. It built the offender list with `mapfile`, a bash-4 builtin. macOS ships
#      bash 3.2 (2007) as /bin/bash, where that builtin does not exist -- and
#      because this file runs `set -uo pipefail` WITHOUT `-e`, the failure was
#      non-fatal. OFFENDERS stayed unset, the `${#OFFENDERS[@]}` test errored to
#      stderr, check 1 -- this file's entire reason to exist -- never evaluated,
#      and the run still printed PASS=6 FAIL=0 and exited 0. Linux CI (bash 4+)
#      is blind to it by construction: a gate cannot catch a defect its own
#      runner is incapable of expressing. Fixed three ways below: a portable
#      read loop, a control proving that loop actually POPULATES, and a
#      check-count invariant that fails loud when any check silently skips.
#      The repo-wide half is tests/integration/test_bash32_portability.sh,
#      which enforces scripts/PORTABILITY.md section 4 over every tracked *.sh.
#
# The companion runtime tripwire in scripts/ci.sh watches the real ~/.claude for
# actual writes. This static half catches the mistake at author time on Linux CI,
# where the runtime half is blind because HOME works there.
#
# Stdlib bash + python3 only. Exit 0 = pass.

# USERPROFILE and confirming none of these wrote into the decoy home. A test that
# starts touching ~/.claude comes OFF this list rather than staying on it.
