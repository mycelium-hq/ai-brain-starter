# CI lock + negative control for the cloud-sync guard's SURFACING path
# (MYC-1133: hooks/surface-sync-guard-findings.py + its host).
#
# WHY: the guard this serves ran daily for three months, correctly reported a
# dozen git repos churning inside a synced folder on EVERY run, and changed
# nothing -- its only sink was a log file. Detection was never the gap; routing
# was. So the thing that must be pinned is not "does the scan find machinery"
# (the scan has its own --self-test) but "do the findings REACH a human".
#
# The delivery path is deliberately indirect: surface-sync-guard-findings.py is
# NOT its own SessionStart hook (that put SessionStart at 20/19 on the footprint
# SLA gate). worktree-footprint-signal.py calls its build_report() instead. That
# indirection is exactly what a test must cover -- a broken import there would
# leave BOTH files present, both self-tests green, and the finding silently
# undelivered. A guard that is working and a guard that is dead both emit
# silence, which is why silence alone is never evidence here.
#
# Asserts, all through the REAL host hook (never build_report in isolation):
#   1. FIRES: a planted high finding reaches SessionStart additionalContext,
#      naming the offending path.
#   2. QUIET: a clean, fresh snapshot produces no sync-guard noise (no cry-wolf).
#   3. STALE: a snapshot older than the staleness window warns that the daily
#      job died -- a dead scheduler and a clean machine otherwise look identical.
#   4. PARTIAL: a truncated root reports unproven coverage, never "clean".
#   5. FAIL-OPEN: a missing or corrupt snapshot never breaks SessionStart.
#   6. NO RE-WALK: the surfacer reads the snapshot only. A per-session walk of
#      every cloud root becomes N concurrent full walks under N sessions, which
#      is the resource storm this guard exists to prevent.
#
# Stdlib python3 + bash only. No network, no git. Tmpdir removed on exit.
