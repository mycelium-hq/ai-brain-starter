test_graphify_stage_select_cache_key.py — stdlib-only regression tests for the
cache-key computation in skills/graphify/scripts/graphify_stage_select.py.

Run: python3 tests/test_graphify_stage_select_cache_key.py
No pytest dependency. Exits non-zero on any failure. Touches no real vault.

Why this file exists
--------------------
graphify_stage_select.py is the sizer: it decides which files still need a paid
LLM extraction and prints the cost estimate the operator approves. It answered
that question by re-deriving graphify's cache key by hand, and the hand-rolled
version disagreed with graphify.cache.file_hash() in four ways at once:

  * it looked in graphify-out/cache/{h}.json, but semantic entries live in
    graphify-out/cache/semantic/{h}.json -- wrong directory, so every lookup
    missed even when the digest was right;
  * it fed the ABSOLUTE path into the digest; the library uses the path
    relative to the vault root, lowercased, precisely so a cache stays valid
    across machines and checkout directories;
  * it hashed the WHOLE .md file; the library hashes only the body below the
    YAML frontmatter, so that a metadata-only rewrite does not invalidate an
    expensive extraction;
  * `except Exception: miss` swallowed every error into the miss pile, which is
    what kept all of the above invisible.

Net effect on a real 437-file vault: 0 cache hits reported against 1,113 valid
entries. The sizer told the operator the corpus needed 185 files and ~401K
tokens; the honest numbers were 74 files and ~250K. A sizer that under-reports
its own cache does not fail loudly -- it just quietly bills you twice.

The invariants below are what "agrees with the library" means in practice.
test_matches_library is skipped when graphify is not importable (it is an
optional runtime dependency); the other four hold regardless and are the ones
that actually encode the four bugs.
