"""Controls for the low-free-disk floor in worktree-footprint-signal.py.

The bug this closes (measured 2026-08-05, 926 GB machine): the only disk line
was a flat 5 GB. Regenerable build output filled the volume from healthy to
2.3 GB free and this hook stayed silent the entire way down, because 5 GB on a
1 TB disk is not an early warning — by then builds already fail and sync daemons
already stall. The floor is now max(5 GB, 5% of the volume), so it fires while
the fix is still cheap.

A threshold that never fires and a threshold that fires too late are the same
bug, so the controls assert BOTH directions:

  * 2.3 GB free of 926 GB (the real incident) -> FIRES   (old flat floor: also fired, but only here)
  * 40 GB free of 926 GB                      -> FIRES   (old flat floor: SILENT — the regression)
  * 300 GB free of 926 GB                     -> silent  (healthy disk stays quiet)
  * 10 GB free of 120 GB small disk           -> FIRES   (proportional floor scales down)
  * 8 GB free of 60 GB small disk             -> silent  (5% = 3 GB; absolute 5 GB floor governs)
  * WORKTREE_FREE_GB pins the floor explicitly
  * the message states free GB, the percentage, and the floor it warned against

[13]-[15] drive the hook's REAL code path with a faked volume, because the
arithmetic controls above would all still pass if the derivation were never
wired into the emitted output.
