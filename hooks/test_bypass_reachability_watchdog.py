"""Class watchdog: a Bash-command gate that honors a `*_BYPASS` env var MUST
also consult the COMMAND STRING for that bypass.

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
A PreToolUse(Bash) gate runs in the HOOK process, whose environment is the
Claude Code SESSION env. An inline `VAR=1 <cmd>` prefix a user or agent types
lives only in the command STRING and never reaches os.environ. A gate that
advertises an inline bypass in its own block message but reads only
os.environ is offering an escape hatch that can never fire -- a permanent
block with a fake exit, which trains people to disable the guard some other
way instead of using the one it names. Bug class
HOOK-READS-SESSION-ENV-NOT-COMMAND-ENV.

FOUR THINGS THIS FILE PROVES, IN ORDER
----------------------------------------
1. The SCANNER (hooks/_lib/bypass_scan.py) detects BOTH shapes a violation
   can take: the bypass name spelled as a literal string, and the bypass
   name hoisted into a module constant. Only the literal shape was checkable
   until this scanner shipped; a scanner that only saw literals would have
   missed 2 of the 5 real violators this repo shipped (check-py-import-
   precommit.py and session-lock.py both hoist BYPASS_ENV into a constant).
2. The CI WATCHDOG: this repo's own tracked hooks/ dir, scanned for real,
   must come back with zero violators. This is the assertion that fails the
   build if a new PreToolUse(Bash) bypass hook ever ships the broken shape.
3. FLEET PROOF: for each hook this change fixed, the exact real invocation
   (subprocess + stdin JSON, matching how Claude Code actually calls a hook)
   still blocks/warns with no bypass present, and now also allows/quiets
   with the inline `VAR=1 <cmd>` prefix -- never only the session-env form.
4. The SessionStart SURFACER (surface-bypass-unreachable.py) correctly
   reports a violator in a fixture "deployed hooks" directory, stays silent
   on a clean one, and stays silent when the directory does not exist.

check-py-import-precommit.py and session-lock.py are ALSO covered end-to-end
(both bypass forms, against real git-repo fixtures with a live sibling /
staged F821) in tests/integration/test_session_coordination_guards.sh --
extended there instead of duplicated here, since that file already builds
the fixtures both hooks need.
