"""
PreToolUse hook: force mutating git ops on the personal Obsidian vault through
vault-safe-commit.sh.

Why: raw `git add/commit/checkout/reset/merge/rebase` inside the 60K-file vault
bypasses the vault-wide mutex and races with other sessions on .git/index.lock.
Documented fallout: index corruption 2026-04-17, 10-min stalls + hundreds of
thousands of tokens burned.

Scope: fires ONLY when the git op targets the personal vault repo itself, or a
worktree of it. The repo is identified by `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, NOT
by a path-string prefix. A string prefix mis-fires on symlinks that sit in the
vault namespace but point at a SEPARATE repo: `🍄 the user's consulting brand/` is a symlink to
~/dev/mycelium-vault, which has its own GitHub remote and is committed with
plain git. Do NOT revert this to `cwd.startswith(VAULT)` — that was the
2026-05-22 bug that wrongly blocked a mycelium-vault commit. Every ~/dev/* repo
and any other non-vault repo passes straight through.

Value-taking git options whose value is a SEPARATE argument are matched WITH
their value, so a subcommand cannot hide behind the value and a quoted value's
space cannot end the match early. `-C <dir>` and an explicit `--git-dir <dir>`
retarget the op (targeting follows them, not the shell cwd); `-c <name>=<value>`,
`--work-tree` and `--namespace` are consumed so the value is not read as the
subcommand. `git -C "<vault>" add`, `git --git-dir="<vault>/.git" add`, and
`git -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null commit` used to evade the hook entirely.

Blocks these subcommands when the repo is the vault:
    git add / commit / checkout / reset / merge / rebase / restore / switch / stash

Allows read-only ops through:
    git status / diff / log / show / ls-files / rev-parse / branch / config / blame

Allows explicit escapes:
    vault-safe-commit.sh ...   (the sanctioned wrapper)
    GIT_VAULT_BYPASS=1 git ... (emergency escape hatch for the user)
