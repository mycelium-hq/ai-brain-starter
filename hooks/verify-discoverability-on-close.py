"""Stop hook: blocks session close if any artifact THIS SESSION authored
lacks a same-session discoverability companion.

Per the same-session discoverability-enforcement rule (codified 2026-05-13
after the gbrain-build wiring gap).

Bug class blocked: ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-DISCOVERABILITY.

Mechanism:
1. Detect closing-claim in the model's last assistant message (the shared
   MENTION-vs-USE-aware detector in _lib/closing_claim.py — the same one the
   session-close-cascade hook uses, so both Stop hooks fire on one surface).
2. If closing claim detected, run discoverability-verifier.py --json on
   the last 24h of commits + recently-modified Agent Memory audit memos.
3. Partition the verifier's gap list into:
     - SESSION-AUTHORED: the gap's artifact file was written/edited by THIS
       session's transcript (Write/Edit/MultiEdit file_path, or a Bash command
       naming the file). These are OUR gaps — HARD-BLOCK the close.
     - SIBLING / PRE-EXISTING: the artifact was not touched by this session.
       In a many-concurrent-session workflow these belong to a sibling session
       (or predate this session). Emit a SOFT informational note only — never
       block. The closing session cannot fix another session's audit memo
       without fabricating cherry-pick analysis for repos it never audited
       (a zero-hallucination violation), so blocking on them only teaches the
       bypass env var, which then masks THIS session's real gaps
       (the over-strict-verification-teaches-bypass failure mode).

Scoping signal: the session transcript (`transcript_path` on stdin) is a JSONL
of this session's tool calls. The set of file paths this session wrote is the
authority for "ours". An artifact flagged by the verifier that does NOT appear
as a write target in this transcript = not-ours = soft note only.

MYC-766 (2026-06-10): before this change the hook hard-blocked on ANY gap the
verifier returned, including sibling sessions' incomplete audit memos surfaced
by the verifier's mtime-based Agent-Memory scan. That false-blocked unrelated
sessions' closes.

VAULT_ROOT: resolved from the VAULT_ROOT env var (default ~/vault), so the hook
is portable across installs — the deploying vault supplies its own root (e.g.
via the Claude settings `env` block). MYC-1270 (cross-repo de-dup: one canonical
copy, the consumer vendors it byte-identical).

Fail-open: a crash in this non-blocking nudge must never crash-block a close.
Any exception → exit 0.

Bypass: DISCOVERABILITY_VERIFIER_BYPASS=1.
