"""Observe local footprint before it bloats — SessionStart signal.

The 102-worktree pileup was discovered only when the machine fell over. That
is the real failure: it was invisible until catastrophic. This hook makes the
footprint observable at every SessionStart so "12 worktrees and climbing" is
seen early, not "102, machine dead" later. Cheap: a couple of git/stat calls,
no per-worktree filesystem walk.

Surfaces (only when something warrants attention — silent when healthy):
  * worktree count over the soft threshold (WORKTREE_WARN, default 8)
  * on-disk worktree dirs git no longer tracks (orphans)
  * AGGREGATE file count across the known bloat-prone dirs (MYC-577). The
    2026-06-06 ~234K-file melt was MULTI-SOURCE (~108K worktrees + ~32K
    .smart-env + ~17K snapshots + ~14K Sessions), but worktree COUNT alone
    sees only one source, so non-worktree regrowth — .smart-env re-indexing
    above all — stayed invisible until the machine fell over. The melt
    threshold (~200K+ files) is the real constraint, so the aggregate is what
    must be observable. Frequency-capped to ~daily (cached count + mtime) so
    SessionStart never pays a full-tree walk on a fragile machine.
  * low free disk on the vault's volume
  * THE DANGEROUS COMBO: an AI-brain vault inside a consumer cloud-sync folder
    (iCloud / OneDrive / Dropbox / Google Drive / Box) — worktree/.git churn
    there is what melts the sync daemon. Detected for ANY such vault — the one
    cwd is in, $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, OR any vault in Obsidian's registry, so a
    pre-existing iCloud vault is caught even outside guided onboarding — and the
    auto-capable relocate is OFFERED as ONE recommended safe action (keep the
    notes where they are, move only the churning machinery out) — never a
    two-option menu a non-technical user can't answer — self-silencing once
    relocated. (MYC-2360 + offer-simplification follow-up)

Bypass: WORKTREE_FOOTPRINT_BYPASS=1.
