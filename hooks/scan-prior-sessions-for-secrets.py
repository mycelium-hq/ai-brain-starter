"""SessionStart hook: scan every project's session JSONL for unredacted secrets.

Defense layer 4 of the secret-detection stack. PreToolUse hookify blocks
forward, PostToolUse redacts on detect, SessionEnd scrubs on close, and
THIS hook catches anything historical that slipped through — from sessions
that ended before the scrub hook existed, or before a given pattern was
added to the registry.

Resource governance (added after a 2026-06-05 freeze on the maintainer's
machine, where the OLD version stamped its 6h cooldown AFTER the slow scan:
every session that started during the scan window blew past the cooldown
and launched its OWN full corpus scan, and four concurrent multi-minute
scans pegged the CPU until the machine froze). The pile-up class is now
closed by FOUR guards, all in this file:

  * single-instance flock — at most ONE scan runs at a time; a concurrent
    session backs off immediately instead of starting a second scan;
  * stamp-at-START — the cooldown marker is claimed BEFORE the work, so a
    session that starts mid-scan sees the cooldown and skips;
  * incremental — once a full pass completes, later runs only read files
    modified since that pass (a handful, not the whole corpus);
  * wall-clock budget + per-file size cap + os.nice(10) — a single pass can
    never run away or starve the foreground session.

Cross-platform note: this stays a SessionStart hook rather than a launchd /
cron worker. ai-brain-starter installs on macOS, Linux, AND Windows, so a
launchd-only worker would silently disable the historical sweep everywhere
except macOS. The four in-session guards above bound the cost so the cold-start
path is safe on every platform; a maintainer who wants the heavy walk fully off
cold-start can schedule this script out-of-band (it is safe to run standalone —
the single-instance flock + budget apply either way).

Behavior:
  - Detect: scans every `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` against the
    registry (`_lib/secret_patterns.scan`). Rate-limited to one run per 6h
    via `.last-secret-scan` marker.
  - Auto-scrub (opt-in via `VAULT_ROOT` env var): if a JSONL's parent
    worktree is NOT currently in `git worktree list`, backups + redacts
    the file in-place. Logs each scrub to
    `~/.claude/secret-detection-log.jsonl` (structured records, NEVER
    secret values).
  - Mid-session safety: a JSONL whose worktree IS active is SKIPPED with
    "will retry next SessionStart after close" — scrubbing a mid-session
    JSONL corrupts Claude Code's resume state.
  - Fail-closed scrub decision: if the active-worktree set cannot be
    positively determined (git error) OR is empty, scrub NOTHING — an
    empty/unknown set is never proof a JSONL is safe (the current session may
    run from the main checkout, which has no `claude/*` worktree entry). See
    `partition_for_scrub`.
  - Warn: surfaces residual findings (post-scrub) + threat-model reminder
    so the next response checks the leak vector before recommending
    rotation.

Environment:
  - `VAULT_ROOT` — absolute path to the user's vault git repo. **Required
    for auto-scrub.** Without it the hook cannot verify which worktrees
    are active and falls back to warn-only mode (safe default — never
    risks corrupting a mid-session JSONL).
  - `SCAN_PRIOR_AUTO_SCRUB_BYPASS=1` — forensic mode: skip auto-scrub
    even when VAULT_ROOT is set. Useful for inspecting findings before
    scrubbing.
  - `SECRET_SCAN_BUDGET_SECONDS` — override the per-pass wall-clock budget
    (applies to both the cold and warm budgets). Ops escape hatch.

Pairs with the other secret-defense layers; see `_lib/secret_patterns.py`
docstring for the full architecture.
