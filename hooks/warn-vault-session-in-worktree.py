"""LOUD tripwire: this session is running inside an Obsidian-vault git worktree.

The bug (MYC-575): the Claude Desktop app's per-session "worktree" checkbox
creates a `.claude/worktrees/<slug>/` checkout. On a CODE repo that is cheap and
correct. On an OBSIDIAN VAULT (repo-root == vault-root, ~6.5K+ files) that
checkout lands INSIDE Obsidian's watched tree -> 250%+ CPU, 2+ GB RAM, crash --
AND the worktree can be silently archived/deleted mid-session (observed twice:
MYC-555, then again 2026-06-17 during a repo-evaluation). Work survives ONLY
because the discipline (edit shared/canonical files at the MAIN vault path +
commit) was followed; a less-careful session would lose worktree-only files.

The real fix is to stop the Desktop app creating the vault worktree at all
(MYC-575, operator-gated: a Desktop toggle / settings lever / upstream request).
A hook can't un-create the worktree the session already started in -- but it CAN
make the bad state LOUD on the first turn so the human aborts and relaunches
plain BEFORE the melt compounds and BEFORE anything is silently lost. This is the
enforcement/tripwire layer; it self-quiets to a no-op once the source fix holds
(a plain vault session never trips it).

Detection reads THREE independent channels; first hit wins. The `.obsidian/`
gate (applied in main()) distinguishes vault from code repo in ALL THREE, so a
code-repo worktree (Desktop `.claude/worktrees/` on a ~/dev repo, or the
sibling-dir `claude-dev-worktree` `~/dev/<repo>-<slug>/`) never fires.
  - Channel A (payload cwd): cwd is under a `.claude/worktrees/` segment. This
    is the terminal/CLI shape AND every tool-time payload (PreToolUse/UPS reliably
    carry the worktree cwd -- proven: check-cd-outside-worktree fires correctly there).
  - Channel B (transcript marker): cwd is the main root; the worktree id is in
    transcript_path as `--claude-worktrees-<slug>` (Desktop SessionStart, when the
    marker is present).
  - Channel C (process-cwd ground truth, payload-INDEPENDENT, ZERO subprocess): the
    melt happens because the SESSION RUNS INSIDE the worktree, so the hook's own
    `os.getcwd()` (the resolved physical path) carries the `/.claude/worktrees/`
    segment even when the harness reported cwd=main at SessionStart (A) with no
    transcript marker (B) -- exactly the 2026-06-17 miss. A linked worktree's git
    toplevel is always a PREFIX of os.getcwd(), so a literal segment match here is a
    complete superset of what `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` would reveal -- git
    was strictly redundant. It was ALSO a subprocess that fired on EVERY plain
    (non-worktree) UserPromptSubmit + PreToolUse(Bash) call -- the 99% case -- a
    fleet-wide hot-path tax (MYC-1176). C is now a pure string test: zero git, zero
    cost on the plain path. Skipped entirely at PreToolUse (the highest-fan-out
    event) where Channel A is authoritative (payload cwd reliably = the worktree).

Wiring: SessionStart (catches terminal launches + Desktop-with-marker early) PLUS
UserPromptSubmit + PreToolUse(Bash) (the tool-time events where the worktree cwd
is reliably present, so Channel A catches the Desktop-SessionStart-miss case; C
backstops SessionStart + UPS via os.getcwd()). A once-per-worktree-slug dedup
sentinel means it warns ONCE per session, not on every prompt/tool. Slugs are
unique per Desktop worktree, so once-per-slug == once-per-session.

Fail-open: any error -> silent continue (a nudge must never block a session).
Telemetry: emits one guard-fire record (_lib/guard_telemetry.log_fire) on the WARN
path only -- never the silent/plain hot path -- so guard-fleet-telemetry classifies
it FIRING not UNINSTRUMENTED (MYC-1176 item 6). Defensive import: no-op if the rail
is absent, so a stripped install never breaks.
Bypass: VAULT_WORKTREE_WARN_BYPASS=1.
Test knobs: VAULT_WORKTREE_WARN_NODEDUP=1 (skip dedup), VAULT_WORKTREE_WARN_STATE_DIR
(redirect the sentinel dir), GUARD_FIRES_LOG (redirect the telemetry sink).

Canonical: ~/dev/adelaida-skills/hooks/ (deployed as a copy to ~/.claude/hooks/
via install.sh). Negative-control test: warn-vault-session-in-worktree.test.sh.
Ports to ai-brain-starter (MYC-576 -- every installed vault hits the same melt);
guard_telemetry.py ports with it (MYC-809 -- port the rails, not just the pattern).
