"""SessionStart hook: surface session artifacts left UNCOMMITTED in a worktree.

A worktree's own checkout sits on a throwaway `claude/<slug>` branch. Anything
written there and not committed is discarded when the worktree is archived
("N uncommitted changes that will be permanently discarded"). Session files,
Decisions, Captures and Time Tracking belong in the MAIN vault.

detect-closing-signal.py resolves close-cascade writes to the main vault
(resolve_main_vault). This hook is the Layer 3 canary: at the NEXT session
start it scans every worktree for uncommitted session artifacts and surfaces
them loudly, so a slip-through is caught the next day instead of silently
discarded weeks later.

Complements surface-orphan-claude-branches.py:
  - that hook : committed-but-unmerged commits on claude/* branches.
  - this hook : uncommitted changes in a worktree working dir.

Output: silent when clean. One systemMessage block if any worktree holds
uncommitted session artifacts.

Performance: git status is pathspec-scoped to the Meta session dirs, so it
never walks the full vault tree.

Bypass: STRANDED_ARTIFACT_SURFACE_BYPASS=1 in env.
