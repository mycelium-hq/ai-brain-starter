"""SessionStart hook: surface when the DEPLOYED ai-brain-starter hook set in
~/.claude/settings.json has fallen BEHIND the COMMITTED hooks.json in the
checkout (MYC-2507). The client-facing twin of the maintainer-only
surface-deployed-hook-drift.py.

THE GAP THIS FILLS (bug class DEPLOY-FAILS-OPEN-SILENTLY-ON-CLIENT):
MYC-720 made the ai-brain-starter CHECKOUT reach every machine — the auto-update
(scripts/ai-brain-auto-update.sh) ff-pulls AND runs install-hooks-user-level.py
itself. But that deploy step is fail-OPEN: if it times out / errors / rolls back,
the updater emits a ONE-SHOT warning for that turn and moves on. The next ~6-day
cycle finds HEAD == origin/main, so it no-ops (no pull, no re-deploy) and the
warning is gone forever. Result: the checkout is current but ~/.claude/settings.json
is STALE — deployed hooks != committed hooks.json — the exact silent-drift class
MYC-720 fought, moved one level up. update-check.sh only checks CHECKOUT-behind
(HEAD..origin), never deployed==committed; the maintainer detector is adelaida-
skills-only. So a paying client whose deploy silently failed has ZERO signal.

WHAT IT CHECKS (cheap, LOCAL only — no git, no network):
  committed = the ABS-owned hooks in this checkout's hooks.json
  deployed  = the ABS-owned hooks in ~/.claude/settings.json
  drift  ==  a committed hook is MISSING from settings.json on its event, OR a
             RETIRED hook is STILL wired there (the install should have removed it).
On drift: one line + the one-command fix. Healthy install: silent (neg-control).
A pinned install (~/.claude/.ai-brain-starter-pinned) is silent too — that file is
the auto-update system's advertised opt-out, and a pinned client never runs the
fail-open auto-deploy this hook watches, so nagging it would break the escape hatch.

WHY IMPORT, NOT COPY, THE OWNERSHIP LOGIC: which hooks are "ai-brain-starter's",
which are retired, and which depend on a vault is defined ONCE in
install-hooks-user-level.py (ABS_FINGERPRINTS / ABS_OWNED_BASENAMES / _is_retired /
_hook_depends_on_vault). A copied list here would rot the instant a hook is
added — the SAME deployed!=committed drift class this hook exists to catch. So we
import those predicates; a new hook is covered automatically once it is added to
the installer's ABS_* lists (which wiring it requires anyway).

SCOPE — NON-vault-dependent hooks only (for the MISSING direction): the auto-
update deploy runs install-hooks-user-level.py WITHOUT a vault path, which PRUNES
vault-content hooks (graph-context-hook.sh / session-end-hook.sh / write-hook.sh —
[VAULT_PATH] with no ~/.claude fallback); those are wired later by /setup-brain
with the real vault path, on a path this fail-open class never touches. Demanding
them here would false-fire on every no-vault / pre-setup client. So this covers
exactly the class the auto-update deploy can silently break, and stays quiet
whether or not a vault exists. Comparing by BASENAME (not full command string)
makes the diff invariant under [VAULT_PATH] substitution — no false positives from
resolved-vs-placeholder paths.

ALSO SURFACES SKILL-CONTENT DRIFT (MYC-3076): the same fail-open-silent class,
one artifact over. sync-skills.py copies updated skill CONTENT into the bare
~/.claude/skills/<name> copies that actually serve a skill — but only inside the
auto-update's `head != origin` branch, so once the clone is current, a lagging
bare copy never catches up and nothing says so (the 2026-07-14 daily-journal +
insights movement mechanics reached the clone but not /journal + /weekly). We
call sync-skills.classify_drift() (its own source of truth, reusing its symlink
/ .git-fork skip guards) and append an upstream-ahead report to the SAME update-
check message — no new SessionStart hook, so the footprint SLA (MYC-2348) is
untouched. Directional: a copy that LEADS upstream is never nagged as behind.

LIMITATION (honest): a detector can only fire once it is itself deployed, so it
cannot report its own first-time non-deployment. After the first successful
deploy it self-perpetuates and catches every subsequent stale deploy. Checkout-
behind (HEAD..origin) is a sibling concern covered by update-check.sh and the
maintainer detector's substrate-checkout section — deliberately NOT re-done here.

Stdlib-only (json/os/sys/importlib/pathlib). Any error -> emit `{}` (fail-open: a
SessionStart surfacer must never crash session start). Hermetically testable via
ABS_SKILL_DIR (committed hooks.json source) + HOME/ABS_SETTINGS_JSON (deployed
settings.json). Test + negative control: tests/integration/test_deployed_hooks_behind.sh.
