warn-stale-dev-checkout.py — PreToolUse guard.

Bug class: STALE-BARE-CHECKOUT-READ (sibling of WRONG-ARTIFACT-VERIFIED).

Incident 2026-06-08 (MYC-670): the ~/dev/mycelium-studio BARE checkout was 147
commits / 2 weeks behind origin/main. A recon Read of its pr-build.yml returned a
stale, JS-only workflow that contradicted the Linear issue. The miss was caught
only by LUCK (the issue described jobs absent from the stale file). A subtler
2-week drift (a 5-line change to an existing job) would have slipped through and
produced a broken / conflicting edit.

Recurrence 2026-06-21 (MYC-1127 re-audit): a `git grep` recon of the same bare
checkout (282 behind) returned NOTHING for a dir that did not exist at the stale
HEAD — nearly mis-concluding "the consumer doesn't exist". The Read tool warned;
the Bash `git grep` did NOT, because this guard only covered Read/Edit/Write.
Coverage now includes Bash read-class commands (git grep/log/show/diff without a
ref, plus cat/grep/rg/sed/head/tail on a checkout path). A ref-qualified read
(`origin/main`) IS the canonical remedy → stays silent.

Root cause: bare ~/dev/<repo> checkouts ROT — all real work happens in per-session
worktrees (which base on origin/main and are fresh by construction), so nobody
ever pulls the bare checkout. Reading it as if it were "current" is the danger.

Fix: when a file-touching tool OR a read-class Bash command targets a STALE bare
~/dev/<repo> checkout, warn once (per session, per repo) with the canonical-state
remedy. Worktrees (<repo>-<slug>, whose .git is a FILE pointer) are fresh by
construction and are skipped. Fail-open, non-blocking.

Discriminator (Julia Evans, panel 2026-06-08): a bare checkout's .git is a DIR
(can rot); a worktree's .git is a FILE (gitdir pointer, fresh off origin/main).

Noise budget (Charity Majors, panel 2026-06-08): fire ONCE per (session, repo),
only on real drift (>= THRESHOLD behind), remedy copy-pasteable. A guard that
cries wolf teaches its own bypass (over-strict-verification-teaches-bypass.md).
Bash precision: a ref-qualified read (origin/main) is the remedy → never warned;
a command merely MENTIONING a fresh repo never warns (gated on real staleness).
