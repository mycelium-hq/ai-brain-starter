"""block-git-mutation-mid-operation.py

PreToolUse(Bash) hook. Refuse any git command that mutates history, refs, the
index or the working tree while the TARGET repository has an operation already
in flight -- a paused rebase, an unresolved merge, a stopped cherry-pick /
revert, or an active bisect.

WHY (incident 2026-07-28). A `git rebase -i` on `main` stalled
at 23:07 the night before and sat paused for 22+ hours. HEAD was detached the
whole time. Every session that day committed onto it -- ~22 commits between
12:05 and 21:09 -- and not one noticed. One session then branched from an
earlier point, and six commits from four different sessions fell off `main`.

The gap, stated precisely: `session-lock.py` already knows the word "rebase" --
it is in that hook's gated-verb list, so it stops you LAUNCHING a rebase while
a sibling session is live. It has no check for a rebase already in flight.
**The existing guard blocks the verb; nothing blocked the state.** A session was
prevented from starting a rebase, and then allowed to commit into someone
else's.

Liveness is the wrong signal and cannot be repaired. A session that starts a
rebase and then goes idle -- usage limit, closed terminal, crash -- leaves the
repo mid-operation while looking exactly like "no session" to a heartbeat
check. This hook therefore reads GIT STATE ONLY. It never consults session
liveness, and it fires the same whether zero or ten siblings are alive.

Routine pre-commit checks did not surface it either: `git status --porcelain`
and `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` both returned survivable-looking answers
while `.git` was mid-rebase. You had to already suspect the problem to ask the
question that revealed it. That is what this hook asks, every time, for free.

WHAT IT CHECKS
  Resolves the git-dir the command would actually act on (honoring `-C <path>`,
  `--git-dir`, an inline `GIT_DIR=`, AND a `cd` earlier in the same command --
  see WHICH REPOSITORY below -- and handling a `.git` FILE that points
  elsewhere: the incident repo keeps its working tree in one place and its
  git-dir in a separate mirror directory, so a naive `<cwd>/.git` guess finds
  nothing). Then looks for:
      rebase-merge/     paused interactive / merge-backend rebase
      rebase-apply/     paused am-backend rebase, or a stopped `git am`
      MERGE_HEAD        merge stopped at conflicts
      CHERRY_PICK_HEAD  cherry-pick stopped at conflicts
      REVERT_HEAD       revert stopped at conflicts
      BISECT_LOG        bisect in progress
  Any present + a mutating verb -> BLOCK (exit 2).

  In a linked worktree this deliberately uses `--git-dir`, not
  `--git-common-dir`: in-flight operation state is per-worktree, so the
  per-worktree git-dir is the correct place to look.

WHICH REPOSITORY (added 2026-08-22, after this hook blocked the wrong repo)
  The hook read `-C`, `--git-dir` and `GIT_DIR`, but not the shell's own `cd`.
  So for the single most common shape an agent emits --

      cd /other/repo && git commit -m ...

  -- the `cd` segment was parsed, found not to be a git call, and discarded;
  the `git commit` segment then resolved against the SESSION cwd. That is the
  wrong repository, and it failed in BOTH directions:

    FALSE BLOCK  session cwd mid-rebase, `cd`-target clean -> refused a commit
                 to a repo that had nothing in flight, citing an unrelated
                 repo's rebase. Measured 2026-08-22. This is the direction that
                 does the lasting damage, because the only way past it is the
                 bypass var, so it teaches everyone to set
                 GIT_INFLIGHT_OP_BYPASS=1 reflexively -- and then the guard is
                 gone for the case it exists to catch.
    FALSE ALLOW  session cwd clean, `cd`-target mid-rebase -> the commit was
                 PERMITTED straight into a paused rebase. Measured the same
                 day. This is the 2026-07-28 incident walking through the front
                 door of the guard written to stop it.

  So the cwd is now tracked across shell segments. Rules, and why each one:
    `cd X && git ...`   -> X. `&&` runs the right side only if `cd` SUCCEEDED,
                           so X is not a guess.
    `cd X ; git ...`    -> X *and* the previous cwd. `;` runs the right side
                           whether or not `cd` worked, so the repo is genuinely
                           ambiguous; both are checked and either one being
                           mid-operation blocks. Conservative on purpose -- the
                           ambiguous case must not be the one that loses work.
    `cd X || git ...`   -> previous cwd. The right side runs only if `cd`
                           FAILED, so the cwd did not move.
    `cd X | git ...`    -> previous cwd. A pipeline component is a subshell;
                           its `cd` does not escape.
  Bare `cd` resolves to $HOME. `cd -` does NOT: tracking $OLDPWD across the
  ambiguous separators is more machinery than that shape is worth, and a wrong
  OLDPWD is a wrong repository, so it takes the fallback below.

  TRACKING IS ABANDONED (falling back to the session cwd -- i.e. exactly what
  this hook did before any of this existed, so the fallback cannot regress it)
  the moment the shell stops being readable:
    - an unquoted `( ... )` subshell anywhere in the command. A subshell scopes
      its `cd` to the group, so in `(cd /a && git commit) && git push` the push
      is back at the ORIGINAL cwd. A tracker that missed the `)` would judge
      the push against /a and could ALLOW a mutation into a stalled repo. The
      detection is quote-aware: `git commit -m "fix (bug)"` must not trip it,
      or the false block comes straight back for parenthesised messages.
    - an unquoted `#` comment. Everything after it is text the shell never
      runs, so a `cd` sitting there is inert -- but it still looks like a
      segment. Measured 2026-08-23, same shape as the two below.
    - an unquoted heredoc (`<<`, `<<<`). A heredoc BODY is data, not commands,
      but it arrives in the same string and its lines look exactly like
      segments. Measured 2026-08-23: `cat <<EOF > f` / `cd /clean && echo hi` /
      `EOF` / `git commit` moved the tracked cwd to /clean off a line the shell
      only ever wrote to a FILE, and the commit into the stalled session cwd
      was ALLOWED where the cwd-blind hook blocked it. Same class as the quoted
      operator above, and the same call `_lib/gh_merge.py` makes.
    - a `cd` whose destination is not a literal path -- `cd $VAR`,
      `cd "$(...)"`, a glob, `cd -`, `popd`, a Windows drive-relative path, or
      more than one operand.
  Command substitution is NOT a subshell for this purpose: `$(cd /x)` cannot
  move the caller's cwd, and it tokenizes as one word, not a bare paren.

DETACHED HEAD gets its own, softer path (a warning, not a block) with its own
message. Committing to a plain detached HEAD is survivable -- you can recover a
commit from the reflog. Committing into a STALLED REBASE's detached HEAD is how
work leaves history, because the next `--abort` moves the branch out from under
it. Same symptom on the surface, different severity underneath; identical
messages would flatten exactly the distinction that cost six commits.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT BLOCKED
  - The RESOLUTION forms: `git rebase|merge|cherry-pick|revert|am
    --abort|--continue|--skip|--quit` and `git bisect reset`. Blocking these
    would trap the repo in the stuck state with the bypass env var as the only
    exit, which trains everyone to disable the guard. Whoever owns the
    operation must be able to end it.
  - Taking a side on a conflicted PATH: `git checkout --ours|--theirs <path>`
    and the `git restore` spelling. Same principle one step earlier, and the
    step that was missing until 2026-08-23. `checkout` and `restore` are both
    mutating verbs, so the guard allowed `--continue` while blocking every way
    to REACH it -- the resolution an operation stops for cannot be performed at
    all. MYC-3779's fourth reporter hit exactly this and bypassed, on a rebase
    they had started themselves seconds earlier. An escape hatch that does not
    reach the exit is not an escape hatch. (`git add` was already allowed: it
    is not a mutating verb by this hook's reckoning.)
  - `git tag` and `git branch`: both were the moves that actually PRESERVED
    work during the incident (a tag anchored an orphan commit; an unrelated
    session branching off it is the only reason six stranded commits survived).
    Neither touches operation state.
  - `git fetch`, `git status`, `git log` and every other read: recovery starts
    with reading.

DELIBERATELY NOT A JUDGMENT CALL THIS HOOK MAKES: whether to `--abort` or
`--continue`. In the incident, `--continue` would have force-moved `main` to a
22-hour-stale base; `--abort` was correct. That determination needs the
operation's intent, which lives with whoever started it. The hook reports the
state and stops; it never suggests a resolution verb.

KNOWN GAPS (documented, low-incidence -- stated so nobody reads this hook as
total coverage). A `git` buried inside another program's argument is not parsed:
`bash -c "git commit"`, `ssh host git commit`, a git call inside a heredoc or a
script this hook never sees. A Windows ABSOLUTE path written with backslashes
(`C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe commit`) is also missed, because the command
arrives as a Bash string and `shlex` correctly treats a backslash as an escape;
parsing it would mean guessing the quoting dialect per command, which would
break ordinary POSIX quoting for everyone to catch a form that a Bash tool
call essentially never emits. Bare `git`, `git.exe` (any case), and
forward-slash paths ARE covered, which is what Git Bash / WSL / PATH
invocations actually look like.

The parser reads leading env assignments, transparent wrappers (`env`/`sudo`/
...), `-C`, `--git-dir`, `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE` and a preceding `cd`, which
is the shape real sessions and agents emit. The incidents this exists for were
plain `git commit` calls, reached either directly or through a `cd`.

Fails OPEN on any error (missing git, unreadable dir, timeout). A correctness
guard that hard-fails would block every git command in the repo on a transient
hiccup; the failure mode it prevents is rare, and the cost of a false block on
every commit is not worth trading for it.

Bypass: `GIT_INFLIGHT_OP_BYPASS=1` (env or inline prefix). Document why.

BYPASS POLICY (decided 2026-08-23, MYC-3779 predicate 4). The bypass stays
self-serviceable, and every use of it is now LOUD.

  Why self-serviceable stays. The guard refuses to judge `--abort` vs
  `--continue` on purpose; that call belongs to whoever owns the operation. A
  bypass only a second party can grant would, in the one case that matters --
  an abandoned operation whose owner is gone -- leave the repo with no exit at
  all. The hook already declines to trap a repo (it never blocks the resolution
  verbs) and this is the same principle one level up.

  Why that was not enough before. MYC-3779 measured three subagents in one
  session independently setting this var. Each had verified its own worktree was
  clean and each was factually right; the guard was evaluating a DIFFERENT repo
  and was unfalsifiable from where they stood. The honest reading is that the
  scoping bug manufactured those bypasses -- which is why the fix is the
  cwd tracking above, not a harder-to-reach escape hatch. Making a correct
  guard harder to bypass would have punished the agents for the guard's error.

  What changed anyway. A bypass that leaves no trace is a comment, not a
  control. The bypass is now evaluated AFTER the repository check rather than
  before it, so the log records what it actually SUPPRESSED -- repo, marker,
  subcommand -- instead of merely that someone had the variable exported. A
  bypass that suppresses nothing writes nothing. Blocks are recorded too, so a
  guard that has gone quiet is distinguishable from one that never fires
  (a dead guard and a healthy one otherwise emit the same signal).
