"""SessionStart hook (MYC-1893): surface bare ~/dev hubs that need a human.

CHEAP by construction — reads the state file the launchd `dev-hub-refresh --apply`
job writes (NO git, NO fetch on the interactive path). The launchd leg owns the
expensive fetch + fast-forward; this leg is the human-visible backstop that says
"these hubs are far behind / dirty / off-branch — the auto-ff couldn't touch them".

Stays SILENT unless something genuinely needs attention (surfaced hub, or a hub
>= THRESHOLD commits behind — a sign the launchd refresh has stalled). Fail-open:
a missing / garbled state file prints nothing (a fresh install seeds it at login;
daemon-liveness is surface-stale-automation-failures.py's job, not this hook's).

Bug class: STALE-BARE-CHECKOUT-READ (MYC-670 / MYC-1127 / MYC-1893).
