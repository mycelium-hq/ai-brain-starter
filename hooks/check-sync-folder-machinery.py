check-sync-folder-machinery.py

Detect the failure class where high-churn / high-count directories (git repos,
node_modules, build output, or any dir with thousands of files) live INSIDE a
cloud File-Provider-synced folder — iCloud "Desktop & Documents", iCloud Drive,
OneDrive, Dropbox, Box, or Google Drive.

WHY: consumer cloud File Providers (iCloud `bird`/`fileproviderd`, Google
`DriveFS`, OneDrive, Dropbox) sync documents well but choke catastrophically on
machinery. Git rewrites `.git/index.lock` and pack objects on every operation,
so the daemon can never converge -> a retry storm (fileproviderd pinned at
70-130% CPU for hours) + silent repo/vault corruption. The phantom-error backlog
can grow into the hundreds of thousands and survives even after you move the
churn out, until the sync DB is rebuilt.

This is a BROADER check than the per-session vault-location signal
(`worktree-footprint-signal.py`, which asks "is THE VAULT in a cloud folder?").
This one asks "is there ANY machinery in ANY synced root?" — so it also catches
side repos, build trees, and caches that aren't the vault but still melt the
daemon. It does a bounded filesystem walk, so it runs as a standalone audit /
periodic (weekly) check, NOT as a per-session hook.

RULE: machinery lives at a local home-root path (e.g. ~/dev, ~/code, ~/<vault>),
backed up by git remotes + a real, restored-and-verified backup. Cloud sync is
for documents only. Sync is not a backup.

Advisory ONLY — always exits 0. Never blocks. Runnable standalone as a
Mac-health audit.

Usage:

  check-sync-folder-machinery.py --json      # machine-readable findings
  check-sync-folder-machinery.py --self-test # negative control (proves it fires)
