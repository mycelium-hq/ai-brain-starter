"""
sessionstart-hook-snapshot-guard.py - warn if a SessionStart hook DISAPPEARED.

A SessionStart hook can silently vanish from settings.json - a linter, a manual
edit, or a parallel session can prune one, and the loss stays invisible until you
happen to notice the missing behavior. This guard snapshots which SessionStart
hooks are wired and warns inline when one disappears.

De-noised: the original diffed exact command STRINGS, so any cosmetic reword by a
concurrent session - `python3` <-> `/usr/bin/python3`, `~/` <-> absolute path,
adding/removing a `2>/dev/null || echo {...}` wrapper or a `[ -f X ] &&` guard -
false-flagged a hook as "missing" when the SAME SCRIPT was still wired. Cry-wolf
is how the ONE real drop gets scrolled past, so the guard now diffs SCRIPT
IDENTITY (script basename + normalized args) instead of raw command text.

WINDOWS: the identity function used to collapse the whole fleet into ONE identity
(MYC-3880). _script_identity() looked for a script path with `([~/][^\\s'\"]*\\.py)`
- rooted at `~` or `/` only. The Windows leg of the installer
(scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py) rewrites every hook into a launcher shim:

    py -3 "C:\\...\\scripts\\hook_runner.py" --fallback silent "C:\\...\\hooks\\<hook>.py"

which contains no `~` and no `/` at all (drive letter, all backslashes). So the
regex never matched, every Windows command fell through to the `c[:100]` trimmed
-text branch, and that 100-char prefix is the launcher preamble - byte-identical
for every hook. Measured on a real Windows install: 25 wired SessionStart
commands -> 7 identities instead of 20, with all 19 Windows-form commands sharing
ONE identity, 19/19 via the text branch. Any one of those 19 could be deleted
from settings.json and this guard stayed quiet, because the surviving siblings
kept the shared identity alive; it could only ever fire if all 19 vanished at
once. The guard's entire purpose was defeated on Windows, while reading healthy.
It was also unstable there: the collapsed identity embedded an absolute path, so
moving the clone invalidated the whole snapshot in one step.

Fix, same idiom as scripts/audit-sessionstart-boundedness.py (MYC-3879) and
scripts/heal-journal-guard.py (#375):
  - _SCRIPT_TOKEN_RE parses quoted paths first (a Windows home MAY contain a
    space) and bare paths last, rooted at `~`, POSIX `/`, a UNC `\\\\share` or a
    drive letter.
  - _RUNNER_SHIM_RE knows hook_runner.py is a LAUNCHER, not a hook, and resolves
    through it to the TARGET it launches. Resolving to the shim would be no
    better than the bug: the launcher is identical for all 19 hooks.
  - the basename is taken with PureWindowsPath, which splits BOTH separators on
    BOTH platforms, so an identity does not depend on which OS computes it.

Same SILENT-NO-OP family as #370/#375/#485 and MYC-3875/3876/3879: a guard that
reads healthy while asleep.

Behavior:
  - Snapshot SessionStart hook IDENTITIES to
    ~/.claude/state/sessionstart-hooks-snapshot.json (versioned: {"v":3,...}).
  - On each fire, diff current identities against the snapshot.
  - Any prior identity MISSING from current -> inline warning (snapshot NOT
    updated, so the warning persists until reconciled).
  - New identities only -> update snapshot silently (additions are fine).
  - First run / corrupt / OLDER-VERSION snapshot -> (re)baseline silently.
  - `--refresh` -> force-rewrite the snapshot to current and exit 0 (this is what
    "if intentional, refresh" means; the old in-band rerun never refreshed
    because the missing-branch skips the update).
  - `--self-test` -> hermetic controls for the identity function, exit 0/1.
    Touches neither settings.json nor the snapshot.

    This line was hardcoded as `python3 ~/.claude/hooks/<this>.py --refresh`, which
    is unrunnable on Windows three ways over: there is no `python3` on PATH (the
    installer probes `py -3` first for exactly that reason), PowerShell does not
    expand `~` in an argument, and the hook is installed under
    ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/hooks/, not ~/.claude/hooks/. So the single
    action this warning asks for could not be performed on the platform where the
    guard was ALSO silently broken (MYC-3880) -- and now that the guard is actually
    wired, that is the first thing a Windows user sees when it fires.

    The launcher stays BARE and only the path is quoted: a quoted first token is a
    string literal in PowerShell, the same rule scripts/hook_runner.py documents.
    __file__ rather than a literal path, so it names wherever this copy really is."""
