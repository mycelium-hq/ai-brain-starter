"""session-lock.py

Sibling-session coordination lock for git repos. Three event modes, one
shared lock file: `<main_root>/.claude/.session-lock.json` (shared across
every worktree of the repo via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`).

SessionStart
    Resolve the MAIN repo root for the session's cwd, read the lock, and if a
    DIFFERENT session was active within the last 5 minutes, warn (informational
    additionalContext). Then upsert THIS session's own entry.

PreToolUse(Bash)  [the enforcement layer]
    Read the lock via this session's cached lock-path pointer (no git on the
    hot path). If a different session is live (<5 min):
      * git-mutating command (commit/push/checkout/switch/branch-create/
        merge/rebase/reset/cherry-pick/revert/pull/am/apply) targeting THIS
        repo -> warn-block EVERY time (exit 2). These are the ops that caused
        the real collision.
      * any other command -> warn-block ONCE per session (exit 2), then stay
        quiet so intentional parallel read-only work isn't nagged.
    Either way, refresh this session's last_activity_at (keep the slot warm).

Stop / any other invocation
    Activity heartbeat: bump last_activity_at on this session's entry.

SCOPE LIMIT -- THIS HOOK GATES THE VERB, NOT THE REPO'S STATE
    `rebase` appears in the gated-verb list above, and that has been misread as
    "rebases are covered." It is not. This hook stops you STARTING a rebase
    while a sibling is live. It has NO idea whether one is ALREADY IN FLIGHT.

    Worse, its signal is LIVENESS, which structurally cannot see the dangerous
    case: a session that starts a rebase and then dies (usage limit, closed
    terminal, crash) leaves the repo mid-operation while looking exactly like
    "no session" to a heartbeat check. Incident 2026-07-28: a rebase stalled
    22+ hours, ~22 commits from several sessions landed on its detached HEAD,
    and six commits from four sessions fell off `main`. This hook was working
    correctly the entire time -- a session was stopped from STARTING a rebase,
    then allowed to commit into someone else's.

    In-flight operation state (rebase-merge/, rebase-apply/, MERGE_HEAD,
    CHERRY_PICK_HEAD, REVERT_HEAD, BISECT_LOG) is covered by a separate,
    liveness-independent gate: hooks/block-git-mutation-mid-operation.py.
    Do not add state checks here -- the two signals have different lifetimes
    and merging them would make this hook's liveness cache authoritative over
    facts that outlive any session.

WHY
---
Worktree isolation (per-session git worktrees) prevents the shared-HEAD
collision structurally, but two sessions can still pick the SAME repo and
clobber each other's in-flight work (SIBLING-SESSION-PARALLEL-COMMIT-COLLISION:
a sibling commits broken state + reverts, wiping in-flight work). The
SessionStart alert is INFORMATIONAL only; it doesn't stop the collision once
both sessions are running. The PreToolUse layer is the gate that actually
blocks the dangerous op, in time, with an explicit bypass.

The lock is a multi-session MAP (every live session keeps its own entry) so
BOTH siblings detect each other — a single-entry lock only lets the
earlier-started session see the later one. Concurrent writers serialize through
a best-effort `flock` sidecar (`.session-lock.lock`) so the read-modify-write
doesn't lose entries when many sessions hammer one repo; the flock is
non-blocking + bounded + fail-open, so it never hangs a tool call.

LIVENESS is `last_activity_at` ONLY. The `pid` field is INFORMATIONAL — it is
the ephemeral hook-process pid (each hook invocation is a fresh, instantly-
exiting process), NOT the long-lived session pid, so it is dead on arrival and
MUST NOT anchor any liveness check. A crashed session stops being "live" after
5 min (no more heartbeats) and is pruned after 30 min.

Never HARD-blocks: every block is bypassable, and only same-repo siblings are
ever gated. Different repos worked in parallel have different lock files and
never interfere. This is a coordination nudge, not a hard control.

Lock + sidecar + tmp files should be gitignored globally (e.g.
`~/.config/git/ignore`) so the per-Bash-call writes never dirty a repo or get
committed. See docs/HOOKS_INSTALL.md for the opt-in install + gitignore step.

Bypass: SIBLING_SESSION_LOCK_BYPASS=1 (intentional parallel / collaborative
work — set it in the session's environment, not as a per-command prefix; like
every other hook bypass it is read from the hook process's env).
