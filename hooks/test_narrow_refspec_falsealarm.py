"""A single-branch clone must not be reported as un-backed-up work.

Every backup check in dev_repo_scan is `git log <ref> --not --remotes`, which
asks "is this commit reachable from a LOCAL remote-tracking ref". On a
single-branch clone (`+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main` — what
`git clone --single-branch`, `gh repo clone` of a big repo, and most CI
checkouts produce) `git fetch` updates origin/main and nothing else. So every
branch except the default has no tracking ref, no matter how thoroughly it was
pushed, and the check answers "unpushed" when the truth is "this repo cannot
tell you locally".

Found live: two repos each reported 1 un-backed-up commit; `git ls-remote`
showed both commits sitting on origin. 13 of 56 repos on that machine — 23% of
the fleet — had the narrow refspec, so this was not an edge case.

"Unknown" and "at risk" are different messages. Merging them is exactly the
cry-wolf failure MYC-683 exists to prevent, so the fix reports the repo in its
own advisory with a one-command remedy instead of inflating the risk count.
