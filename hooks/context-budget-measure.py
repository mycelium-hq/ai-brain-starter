"""
context-budget-measure.py — SessionStart guard: measure the always-loaded TEXT
layer and warn when it grows.

The always-loaded text layer — global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md + the project's
CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md + the project's CONTEXT.md — is paid in tokens on EVERY
turn of EVERY session, forever. It is the most expensive context in the system
and the one with no measurement guard: plugin / MCP load is measured
(token-economics), MEMORY.md has its own cliff guard, but the CLAUDE.md kernel
files themselves silently grow until a new session opens already-full.

This hook measures that layer each SessionStart and:
  • warns if a file exceeds its hard ceiling (default: global CLAUDE.md > 40 KB),
  • warns if the TOTAL grew past a stored baseline (drift detection),
  • silently RATCHETS the baseline DOWN when the layer shrinks (records new low),
  • stays silent when healthy.

Ratchet semantics: baseline = the lowest total seen (the floor). Growth above
floor + tolerance warns and does NOT move the floor — it keeps surfacing until
you slim back, OR run `--accept` to acknowledge an intentional add as the new
floor. A shrink updates the floor silently. This is a measure-and-warn ratchet,
NOT a governance framework — match the guard to the recurrence rate.

Scope safety (the floor must reflect a real project session, not whatever cwd
the command happened to run in). `discover()` finds the project CLAUDE.md /
MEMORY.md / CONTEXT.md by walking up from cwd; run from a NON-project cwd (e.g.
a bare home dir) it finds ONLY the global kernel, so a naive `--accept` / silent
ratchet there would record a global-only floor that clobbers a real multi-file
floor and silently kills drift detection. Two guards prevent that:
  • a baseline is recorded ONLY from a project-anchored discovery (at least one
    project-scoped file present) — `--accept` from a non-project cwd refuses
    fail-loud + exits nonzero; the SessionStart ratchet just skips,
  • the recorded baseline persists its file-KIND set, so a later discovery that
    is a strict SUBSET of those kinds (a narrower scope) never silently ratchets
    the floor down.
Bug class: GUARD-RECORDS-BASELINE-FROM-WRONG-SCOPE (cwd-relative-fragility).

Fail-open: a SessionStart nudge must NEVER crash-block a session.
Freq-capped: warns at most once per day.
Bypass:  CONTEXT_BUDGET_BYPASS=1
Accept an intentional growth as the new floor:  context-budget-measure.py --accept
Tune ceilings (bytes):  CONTEXT_BUDGET_GLOBAL_CEILING (default 40000)

Modes:
  (no args, reads stdin JSON)  SessionStart hook mode — emits additionalContext or no-ops
  --report                     print the table to stdout (human / CLI)
  --accept                     set the baseline floor to the current total
                               (refuses + exits nonzero from a non-project cwd)
  --self-test                  positive + negative control; exit 0 iff all pass

Bug class: ALWAYS-LOADED-TEXT-UNMEASURED (sibling of ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-MEASUREMENT).
MEMORY.md remediation is owned by check-memory-md-cap.py — this hook measures
MEMORY.md for the total but does NOT duplicate its cliff warning.
