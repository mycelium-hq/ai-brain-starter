"""Regression tests for the two secret-scan residuals.

These cover the failures that the in-session freeze fix (single-instance lock +
incremental + budget) did NOT close:

  1. partition_for_scrub() is FAIL-CLOSED. When the active-worktree set is None
     (git error / cannot determine) OR an empty set, scrub NOTHING.
     NEGATIVE CONTROL: the pre-fix code returned an empty set on a git error and
     then scrubbed EVERYTHING (fail-OPEN — it corrupted active-session JSONLs).
     test_partition_fail_closed_{none,empty} assert the OPPOSITE and FAIL loudly
     if the code ever regresses to fail-open.

  2. hex-256bit no longer fires on the Workflow runtime's `"key":"v2:<hex>"`
     content-addressed cache keys, BUT still fires on a bare 64-hex secret
     (both directions). The SAME redact() runs in the SessionEnd scrub, so a
     missing carve-out would rewrite the cache key and break Workflow resume.

Run: python3 hooks/test_scan_prior_sessions.py
(Also wired into CI via tests/integration/test_scan_prior_failclosed_scrub.sh.)
