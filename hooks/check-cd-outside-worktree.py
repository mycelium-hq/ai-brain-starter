"""check-cd-outside-worktree.py

PreToolUse(Bash) hook. When the session is rooted in a git worktree
(`<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>/...`), block any `cd` / `pushd` whose
resolved target lands in the MAIN checkout tree but OUTSIDE the worktrees
subtree.

Why: CONCURRENT-SESSION-HEAD-DRIFT. A worktree has its own HEAD; the main
checkout has a different HEAD shared with every other main-checkout session.
`cd` into the main checkout from a worktree-spawned session, then a commit /
branch op lands on whatever branch the MAIN checkout (or a parallel session)
currently points at — not the worktree's `claude/<slug>` branch. Observed
repeatedly in long multi-session workflows (a ~30-minute reflog rescue in one
real incident) despite a codified worktree-isolation rule. The rule existed; the
enforcement layer did not. This is that layer.

Detection:
  - cwd (from payload) matches `<main>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>` → worktree
    session; `<main>` is the shared main checkout.
  - Each `cd`/`pushd` target in the command is resolved against cwd
    (absolute targets ignore cwd; relative `..` climbs resolve too).
  - Block if the resolved target is `<main>` itself OR under `<main>/` but NOT
    under `<main>/.claude/worktrees/` (staying anywhere inside the worktrees
    subtree is fine; that's still HEAD-isolated).

Recommended instead: stay in the worktree, or use `git -C <path> ...` for
read-only queries against the main checkout (no cwd change, no drift).

Known gaps (documented, low-incidence): `cd` nested inside `bash -c "..."` or
other quoting layers is not parsed; env-var targets beyond `~`/`$HOME` are not
expanded. The real-world incident that motivated this was a bare absolute
`cd`, which this catches.

Bypass: `WORKTREE_CD_BYPASS=1` (document why — e.g. a deliberate one-off
read-only op in the main checkout).
