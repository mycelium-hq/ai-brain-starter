"""Keep the worktree count near the live-session count — at SessionStart.

The session-end removal hook (remove-ended-worktree.py) keeps the count low in
the normal case. This is the BACKSTOP for the abnormal case: a session that
crashes or is killed before SessionEnd fires leaves its worktree behind. Over
enough crashes those accumulate again — and on a large vault each worktree is a
FULL checkout (thousands of watched files), so waiting for a blunt count cap to
fill before reclaiming is far too slow (the file watcher melts long first).

DESIGN: two layers, reclaim-then-ALLOW, never block.

  Layer A — per-session backstop (runs EVERY session, regardless of count):
    * DEAD-SESSION reap — a registered `claude/<slug>` scratch worktree whose
      owning session is no longer live (per `.claude/.session-lock.json`) is
      reclaimed promptly, regardless of the cap. Liveness is read from the lock;
      a live session's worktree (even idle) and the current one are NEVER touched.
      This is what actually keeps up with crashes — the count tracks live
      sessions instead of drifting up to the cap.
    * ORPHAN-DIR sweep — dirs under `.claude/worktrees/` that git no longer
      registers (relocation-copied / half-created) are reclaimed (relocation-aware,
      snapshot-safe). The cap loop can't see these (it reads `git worktree list`).

  Layer B — count cap (ceiling for many concurrent LIVE sessions):
    Power users run many concurrent sessions; a hard block on creation would break
    that. So when the count is over the cap we reclaim the OLDEST idle `claude/<slug>`
    scratch worktrees (snapshot first, keep branch refs) until back under it.
    Active worktrees (touched <60min), the current one, and deliberate
    feature-branch worktrees are never touched. If everything over the cap is
    active, we surface a note and leave them — correctness over the cap.

Cap:            WORKTREE_MAX env (default 12).
Dead-idle gate: WORKTREE_DEAD_IDLE_MIN env (default 60, matching the cap reaper) —
                a dead-session/orphan worktree must be untouched this long AND its
                session must be absent from the lock's recency window before reclaim.
Bypass:         WORKTREE_CAP_BYPASS=1.

LIVENESS NOTE: per session-lock.py, the only trustworthy liveness signal is
`last_activity_at` recency (the recorded pid is the ephemeral hook pid, dead on
arrival). live_session_cwds() therefore uses recency; this hook never reaps a cwd
that is active in that window, nor the current session's worktree.
