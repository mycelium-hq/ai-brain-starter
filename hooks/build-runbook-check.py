"""
PreToolUse guard for Agent calls that look like build/ship/skill/MCP/connector/hook
work but where Build Standards.md (and MCP Build Runbook.md when applicable) was
not read in the recent tool history.

Triggered by /multi-agent-build patterns that historically skipped the runbook
read and incurred MCP Lesson #22 + #23 penalties (parallel agents diverging on
schema, schema collapse on >50-file chunks, no normalize-before-merge step).

Bypass: set `BUILD_RUNBOOK_BYPASS=1` in env.

Wired via PreToolUse matcher: "Agent" in ~/.claude/settings.json or
.claude/settings.local.json. Action: warn (does not block; surfaces a one-line
reminder before the agent dispatches).

Lesson refs:
- ⚙️ Meta/Build Standards.md (pre-build checklist, optimization pass, MiniMax preprocessing, tool stack cross-reference)
- ⚙️ Meta/MCP Build Runbook.md Lessons #22 + #23
