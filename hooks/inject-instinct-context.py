inject-instinct-context.py — SessionStart hook (once per session-segment).

Realizes the project-scoping half of the Instinct Engine: at session start,
load the high-confidence instincts whose `project_id` is the CURRENT project
OR `global`, and EXCLUDE instincts scoped to other projects. That exclusion is
the isolation feature — a repo-specific convention does not bleed into
unrelated work.

Wired on SessionStart, NOT UserPromptSubmit: the selection is prompt-INDEPENDENT
(stdin is only read for the session id below), so it is session-stable and must
be injected ONCE, not per message. `once: true` is ignored in settings.json (the
installer's merge target), so a UPS `once` hook silently re-fires every message —
this block was measured re-injecting 14x in one session (MYC-2359). SessionStart
fires once per session-segment (startup / resume / post-compact), landing the
block in the cached prefix → served as cache-reads thereafter, not fresh tokens
every turn.

TWO THINGS THIS HOOK DOES BEYOND RENDERING THE BLOCK:

1. **It writes an injection ledger.** The selection computed here is the only
   deterministic record that an instinct was actually PUT TO WORK, and it used
   to be discarded — leaving `confidence` with no feedback channel at all, so
   every stored number stayed the seed it was born with. One appended line per
   session-segment is what `instinct.py promote` later reads. This is the
   substrate's analog of the shipped runtime learning loop's retrieval CITATION
   signal (MYC-818 / MYC-916).

2. **It reserves EXPLORE slots.** Ranking purely by confidence is a closed
   loop: only injected instincts can earn exposures, only exposed instincts can
   be promoted, so the top-N freezes and the rest of the library can never
   acquire evidence no matter how good it is. A minority of the budget goes to
   in-scope instincts BELOW the floor with the fewest exposures, rotated by
   session id so different sessions sample different candidates. Explore picks
   are LABELLED in the block — an unproven instinct must not read like a
   confirmed one.

Silent if the engine isn't installed or nothing clears the confidence floor.
Fail-open: any error -> neutral passthrough, never blocks the prompt. The
ledger write is best-effort and can never fail the injection.
