"""Every hook must actually RUN. Nothing asserted that, and two never did.

THE CLASS (MYC-3537)
  A hook that raises at module import is the maximally silent failure. There is
  no partial run, no half-written file, no wrong answer -- the hook is simply
  not there, while the install continues to report it as present. Nothing in the
  suite executed most hooks, so the cheapest possible assertion (run it, look at
  the exit code) was the one nobody was making.

  Found this way, both dead on arrival for their entire lives:

    auto-capture-public-ships.py   ZoneInfo("America/user-local-tz"), an
                                   unsubstituted template placeholder. Crashed
                                   on EVERY platform. (#420)
    scan-prior-sessions-for-secrets.py
                                   `import fcntl` at module scope. fcntl is
                                   POSIX-only, so this SECRET SCANNER crashed at
                                   import on every Windows install -- and the
                                   file's own docstring says it supports Windows.

TWO GATES, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT SEE THE OTHER'S BUG
  1. SMOKE (dynamic): run each hook hermetically and fail on a Python
     traceback. Catches the tz class -- a crash on the platform running CI.
  2. PLATFORM IMPORTS (static): ban an unguarded module-level import of a
     platform-only stdlib module. CI runs Linux, so the smoke pass CANNOT see a
     Windows-only import crash; `import fcntl` is invisible to it and sailed
     through every green build. The static half is what makes the Windows class
     visible from a Linux runner, and vice versa.

Neither gate asserts behaviour -- that belongs in each hook's own suite. These
two only assert that the hook EXISTS as a running program on every platform the
project installs on, which is the floor both bugs fell through.
