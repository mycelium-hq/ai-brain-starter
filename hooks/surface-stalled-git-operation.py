"""SessionStart hook: surface a git operation that has been IN FLIGHT too long.

WHY. `block-git-mutation-mid-operation.py` refuses commits/pushes while a repo
has a paused rebase / merge / cherry-pick. That guard is correct and stays. But
it is registered PreToolUse ONLY, so it is a WALL, never a SIGNAL:

  - You learn the operation exists only when you try to mutate.
  - The block correctly says the abort/continue call belongs to whoever owns
    the operation -- so a passing session, correctly, does not resolve it.
  - Nothing anywhere reports HOW LONG it has been stalled.

Net effect: every session hits the wall, each defers to an owner who is not
coming back, and the repo stays frozen. Measured five times on mycelium-vault
(MYC-3777 7 days, MYC-3451 22 hours, MYC-3982 ~6 hours, MYC-3781, and a
5-hour stall on 2026-08-24 that held 19 commits from several sessions). Each
was recovered as a one-off INCIDENT; the detector was never built. This is it.

WHAT IT DOES. At session start, for the CURRENT repo only (O(1) -- no tree
walk, no worktree sweep), it checks for an in-flight operation and reports its
AGE. Silent when clean, and silent for a young operation, because a rebase you
started ninety seconds ago is not an incident.

It deliberately does NOT tell you to abort. Which of --abort / --continue is
right is a real judgement about someone's in-flight work, and this hook has no
standing to make it. It reports the fact, the age, and what is blocked.
