"""No reaper may delete a worktree that has a LIVE PROCESS in it.

THE BUG CLASS. Every liveness gate these tools had was a PROXY, and every proxy
reads a BUSY session as a dead one:

  * the session lock records `last_activity_at`, refreshed when a tool call
    STARTS -- so a session sitting inside ONE long call (a test suite, a build,
    a migration) emits nothing for the whole run. Past the liveness window its
    entry is byte-identical to that of a session that exited, and past
    idle-expiry the entry is deleted outright. The lock's recorded pid cannot
    rescue it: that is the ephemeral hook process's pid, dead when written.
  * `is_idle()` / idle-days read mtime, and "nothing written here for an hour"
    is also exactly what a long build whose output goes elsewhere looks like.

So the harder a worktree is being worked in, the deader it looks. Observed in
the field: a worktree removed mid-test-run, several commits deep, by a sibling
session's start-up sweep.

WHAT EACH TOOL'S BLOCK PINS. These are CALL-SITE controls, not helper controls:
a correct helper that nothing calls is precisely the failure worth catching, so
every guarded remover gets its own four legs.

  [positive]      the same fixture IS deleted when nothing is running. Without
                  it a negative control passes for the wrong reason -- a tool
                  broken into never deleting anything would look perfect.
  [negative]      a real child process whose cwd is a SUBDIRECTORY of the
                  worktree (a test runner sits in one, not at the root) makes
                  the tool refuse. Its readiness wait reads the process table
                  DIRECTLY, never through the code under test: routing it
                  through the probe would let a broken probe fail the HELPER
                  instead of the assertion that matters.
  [fail-closed]   an unusable probe refuses. "No process found" and "could not
                  look" must never be the same answer to a caller that deletes.
  [importable]    the probe actually resolved in this layout. A None probe
                  refuses forever, which is safe but paralyses cleanup, so it
                  has to be a test failure rather than a quiet fleet.

Every fixture lives inside the test's own TemporaryDirectory, and every artifact
path these tools resolve (snapshot roots, cleanup logs, reclaim manifests) is
redirected there in setUp -- a suite that writes into the real recovery store is
indistinguishable from a real rescued worktree exactly when someone is looking
for one.
