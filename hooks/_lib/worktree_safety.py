"""Shared worktree-safety helpers for the worktree-lifecycle hooks.

Why this exists
---------------
Git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/<slug>/` are throwaway per-session
scratch checkouts. Nothing in stock Claude Code removes them when a session
ends, so on an active machine they accumulate — each one a FULL checkout of
the vault. Left alone they reach hundreds of worktrees / millions of files,
which then melts any cloud-sync daemon (iCloud / OneDrive / Dropbox) pointed
at the vault and burns disk. This module is the safe-cleanup core shared by:

  - remove-ended-worktree.py      (SessionEnd: clean up the just-ended one)
  - enforce-worktree-cap.py       (SessionStart: bound the total, reclaim-then-allow)
  - worktree-footprint-signal.py  (SessionStart: observe before it bloats)

The recovery-content boundary
-----------------------------
The lifecycle behavior in this module predates the cloud-safe reader. This
module does not claim to solve exclusion against a concurrent writer. It does
guarantee that recovery classification never performs an unbounded content read:

  * COMMITTED work       -> preserved by the branch ref (`git worktree remove`
                            keeps the `claude/<slug>` branch; only the working
                            directory is deleted).
  * content already in git -> bytes are read once through `safe_read`, hashed
                            locally, then checked with `git cat-file`; Git never
                            reopens a candidate path.
  * genuinely-unsaved    -> content that hashes to a blob NOT in the object DB.
                            We SNAPSHOT these to the main repo before deletion.

An offline placeholder, special file, timeout, oversize file, or Git hiccup is
uncertainty and therefore makes the existing caller refuse cleanup. Strong
atomic deletion still requires an upstream writer lease / pre-create contract.

Portable: no hardcoded paths; resolves the repo from cwd / CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR.
Pure stdlib.

# Process-table liveness — the only liveness signal here that cannot go stale.
#
# THE BUG CLASS: every other gate in this module is a PROXY for "is anyone
# using this worktree", and every one of them reads a BUSY session as a dead
# one.
#
#   * The session lock records `last_activity_at`, and the hook that refreshes
#     it fires when a tool call STARTS. A session sitting inside ONE long call —
#     a test suite, a build, a migration — emits no heartbeat for the whole run.
#     Past the liveness window its entry is byte-identical to that of a session
#     that exited, and past the lock's idle-expiry the entry is deleted outright.
#     The lock's recorded pid cannot rescue this: it is the ephemeral hook
#     process's pid, already dead when it is written.
#   * `is_idle()` reads mtime, and "nothing written here for an hour" is also
#     exactly what a long build whose output goes somewhere else looks like.
#
# So both proxies answer "gone" for a session that is merely BUSY: the harder a
# worktree is being worked in, the deader it looks. Observed in the field: a
# worktree was removed mid-test-run, several commits deep, by a sibling
# session's start-up sweep; the commits survived only because they were already
# in the shared object store.
#
# The process table knows nothing about heartbeats and cannot go stale, so it is
# consulted before every deletion path in this package.
#
# Related but NOT the same primitive: `_lib/dev_repo_scan.live_process_cwds()`
# is an ADVISORY liveness probe scoped to agent processes, which reports
# "could not measure" and lets its caller fall through to lock files. This one
# is a DELETION GATE: it sees every process, and it RAISES rather than ever
# letting "could not look" be mistaken for "nobody is here".
