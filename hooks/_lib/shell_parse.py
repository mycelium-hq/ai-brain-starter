"""shell_parse — quote-aware primitives for hooks that must reason about a
Bash command STRING before the shell runs it.

A PreToolUse(Bash) guard is handed one string and has to answer questions a
naive `re.split` cannot: which commands are actually in here, where would each
one run, and which of them carries the advertised bypass. Every hook that
hand-rolled that walk grew its own set of fail-opens, because all four of the
hard parts are invisible until they bite:

  - QUOTES. `echo "hi; cd /tmp" && git push` has ONE `cd`-looking token and it
    is inside a string. A splitter that ignores quotes forges a segment
    boundary there and reads a `cd` the shell never runs.
  - SEPARATORS. `cd X && cmd` runs cmd in X; `cd X || cmd` runs it in the OLD
    cwd, because the right side of `||` runs only when the left FAILED. A
    splitter that discards the operator cannot tell those apart, and every
    consumer read `cd /tmp || git push` as a push from /tmp.
  - HEREDOC BODIES. A heredoc body is data, never commands, but it is full of
    real operator characters. Truncating at the first `<<` instead (the older
    approach) threw away every command AFTER the heredoc, which is where the
    interesting one usually is.
  - `$VAR`. `W=/path; cd "$W" && git push` is the shape people actually write.
    Without expansion the target is the literal string `$W`, which resolves to
    no repo at all -- and a guard that reads "no repo" as "not my repo" fails
    open on precisely the command it exists to catch.

Shared primitive, per-caller policy: this module answers "what does the shell
see", never "should it be allowed". Callers keep their own scoping and
fail-open/fail-closed decisions, which differ by guard.
