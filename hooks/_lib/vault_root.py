"""vault_root — single source of truth for session-close vault-root resolution.

Used by every consumer in the session-close cascade:
  - hooks/detect-closing-signal.py            (Layer 1, UserPromptSubmit)
  - hooks/verify-session-close-cascade.py     (Layer 3, Stop)
  - hooks/verify-discoverability-on-close.py  (Layer 3, Stop)

Each of these previously computed its own vault root independently from
`os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT", ...)`, with no awareness of cwd or which repo
the session was actually working in.

Bug this fixes: a machine-wide VAULT_ROOT default (set once, e.g. in Claude
Code's settings.json `env` block, so every hook subprocess always sees it
set) permanently wins over cwd — `os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT") or cwd` never
reaches the `or cwd` branch once VAULT_ROOT is set globally. A session
working inside a SEPARATE vault-shaped repo (its own CLAUDE.md, its own
Session End/Close cascade, its own Sessions/Decisions folders — e.g. a
standalone vault repo, or a team folder with its own cascade) had its
session artifacts silently resolved against the unrelated default vault
instead, and any Stop-hook verifier checked the wrong vault for the
artifacts Layer 1 told the model to write — a fix to Layer 1 alone would
have turned that silent mis-filing into a false hard-block, since the
verifiers would look for files that now correctly exist somewhere else.

resolve_vault_root() restores cwd-derived detection as the HIGHER-priority
signal: it walks up from cwd looking for the nearest self-contained vault
(a CLAUDE.md that declares its own Session End/Close cascade + an existing
Meta folder) and uses that when found. The VAULT_ROOT env var / cwd fallback
is now exactly that — a fallback for when no such repo is found (untracked
locations, or a session already rooted in the default vault itself, which
never needs the walk-up to win since it's reached via the fallback anyway).

TWO RESOLVERS, TWO SURFACES (MYC-3529)
    resolve_vault_root(cwd, env)  — SESSION-scoped. "Which vault does THIS
        session's close cascade write to?" Keyed on a CLAUDE.md that declares
        its own Session End/Close cascade, because that is the thing being
        asked about. Always returns a Path (cwd is the floor).

    vault_root_for(target)        — PER-TARGET. "Which vault governs THIS
        file / directory?" Keyed on a Meta-suffixed folder, the same signature
        scripts/_meta_resolver.py uses, because a hook fires on paths in ANY
        vault and most of them never declare a close cascade. Returns None
        when no vault can be identified, so a caller SKIPS rather than
        guessing at `~/vault` — the #375/#404 defect shape.

    The distinction is the whole point of MYC-2505's severity tagging: a
    SCRIPT serves one vault, a SESSION has one vault, but a HOOK fires on
    files in any vault and must resolve per target or it silently answers for
    the wrong one. `$VAULT_ROOT` is the FALLBACK in both, never the primary.

    Why the marker does NOT get to skip the Meta check (reversed 2026-08-22;
    it originally did): `.session-close-root` is a DOTFILE, and dotfiles
    propagate by accident in ways a prose heading never does — committed to a
    repo and cloned, swept up by `cp -r`, baked into a scaffold or template,
    invisible in `ls`. A stray marker that captures a folder as a vault root
    sends the operator's session artifacts INTO that folder — for a cloned
    client repo, that means private notes landing in someone else's tree,
    potentially committed and pushed.

    Requiring a Meta dir makes a stray marker INERT until a human also creates
    somewhere to write, which is a far higher bar to clear by accident. The
    earlier argument for skipping it was that honoring the declaration and then
    failing loudly beats a silent fallback — but that premise was wrong: the
    fallback is not silent either. The offsite warning added alongside the
    unscaffolded-vault notice already announces when resolution lands outside
    the working folder. Both paths are loud, so loudness cannot break the tie;
    accidental-capture risk does.
