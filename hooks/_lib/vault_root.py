"""vault_root — single source of truth for session-close vault-root resolution.

Used by every consumer in the session-close cascade:
  - hooks/detect-closing-signal.py            (Layer 1, UserPromptSubmit)
  - hooks/verify-session-close-cascade.py     (Layer 3, Stop)
  - hooks/verify-discoverability-on-close.py  (Layer 3, Stop)

Each of these previously computed its own vault root independently from
`os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT", ...)`, with no awareness of cwd or which repo
the session was actually working in.

Bug this fixes: a machine-wide VAULT_ROOT default (set once, e.g. in Claude
Code's settings.json `env` block, so every hook subprocess always sees it
set) permanently wins over cwd — `os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT") or cwd` never
reaches the `or cwd` branch once VAULT_ROOT is set globally. A session
working inside a SEPARATE vault-shaped repo (its own CLAUDE.md, its own
Session End/Close cascade, its own Sessions/Decisions folders — e.g. a
standalone vault repo, or a team folder with its own cascade) had its
session artifacts silently resolved against the unrelated default vault
instead, and any Stop-hook verifier checked the wrong vault for the
artifacts Layer 1 told the model to write — a fix to Layer 1 alone would
have turned that silent mis-filing into a false hard-block, since the
verifiers would look for files that now correctly exist somewhere else.

resolve_vault_root() restores cwd-derived detection as the HIGHER-priority
signal: it walks up from cwd looking for the nearest self-contained vault
(a CLAUDE.md that declares its own Session End/Close cascade + an existing
Meta folder) and uses that when found. The VAULT_ROOT env var / cwd fallback
is now exactly that — a fallback for when no such repo is found (untracked
locations, or a session already rooted in the default vault itself, which
never needs the walk-up to win since it's reached via the fallback anyway).
