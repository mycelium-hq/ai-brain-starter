"""Shared scanner for in-flight builds across ~/dev/* repos.

Used by:
- block-branch-switch-with-untracked-build.py (PreToolUse)
- nudge-checkpoint-after-pytest-pass.py (PostToolUse)
- warn-uncommitted-builds-on-stop.py (Stop)
- list-wip-stashes-on-session-start.py (SessionStart)

Heuristic for "in-flight build":
- A directory under <repo> contains 3+ untracked source files matching
  one of: .py .ts .tsx .js .jsx .go .rs .java .rb .php .c .cpp .h
- OR a new test file exists alongside a new module (tests/X/* + src/X/*)

Heuristic for "active repo": modified within the last 60 minutes.
Faster than scanning every ~/dev/* repo every session-start.

    files named `.session-lock` — the probe both copies used. session-lock.py

#
# collect_drift above headlines exactly two classes (no-remote repos, unpushed
# commits on a DEFAULT branch) and folds everything else into one suppressed
# count. That volume-based demotion is right for cry-wolf reasons and wrong on
# one axis: a branch named `claude/myc-3252-…` is not topic-branch noise. The
# ticket ID in the name is an explicit statement that this is CLAIMED WORK
# against a tracked issue — the highest-value stranded thing in the tree, and
# precisely what today's policy suppresses.
#
# Measured, twice, on the same class:
#   * MYC-3252 (2026-07-24) — `claude/myc-3252-inkcap-generate-dead` held a
#     complete, tested P1 fix plus a novel CI gate. UNPUSHED, session dead 9h. A
#     second session was on course to re-derive it from scratch; what caught it
#     was the concurrent-session check firing on the local worktree path, which
#     only worked because the worktree happened to still be on disk.
#   * MYC-86 (2026-07-27) — `origin/claude/myc-86-consent-pause` held 1292
#     insertions already through adversarial review. PUSHED, 15h, NO PR, because
#     that session hit its usage limit mid-flight.
#
# The second case widens the predicate and is why this is not simply an
# unpushed-branch feature: pushed-with-no-PR is invisible to a DIFFERENT set of
# detectors, which is why it survived. dev-repo-reaper sees a pushed branch as
# healthy (nothing is at risk of loss); the unpushed surface skips it for the
# same reason; nothing in the PR-watching path sees it because there is no PR.
# It falls in the gap between "safe from loss" and "visible to review" — the
# unpushed case at least trips a loss-risk detector, this one trips nothing.
#
# Volume is a SECOND promotion axis, not a replacement: a 2026-07-25 sample of
# 40 `claude/*` branches on one repo found 3 with no PR ever, one of them
# `claude/adoring-hypatia-f30d1a` carrying 9 commits under a generated name — the
# largest stranded thing on disk and exactly what a name-only rule fails to see.
