"""closing_claim — single source of truth for "is this assistant message
claiming to close the session?"

Used by the Stop-side verify hooks (verify-session-close-cascade.py,
verify-discoverability-on-close.py), which previously each carried their own
DRIFTED copy of CLOSING_PATTERNS / NEGATION_PATTERNS / is_closing_claim.

Hazard this guards (MYC-791, promoted to High after it tore down a worktree
mid-session 2026-06-19): a guard that scans assistant text for close PHRASES
false-fires when the assistant is MENTIONING those phrases rather than USING
them — quoting a sign-off as an example, discussing the close machinery, or
defining what does/doesn't count as a close. The distinction is USE vs MENTION.
The live incident: a report that listed "good night" / "buenas noches" as
quoted examples of phrases that should NOT auto-close was itself read as a
close claim, blocked the turn, and triggered worktree archive-prep.

Resolution (USE beats MENTION):
  1. Strip MENTION spans before matching — fenced code, inline backticks,
     markdown blockquote lines, and double-quote spans. A close phrase that
     survives ONLY inside a mention is a reference, not a claim. (Genuine
     closes are never quoted, so they survive stripping and still fire.)
  2. If an explicit DISCUSSION / DEFINITIONAL marker is present (terms that do
     not appear in a genuine first-person sign-off), it is not a claim.
  3. Otherwise, a CLOSING_PATTERN in the stripped text IS a claim.

Single-quote spans are intentionally NOT stripped: apostrophes in ordinary
prose ("don't", "it's") would fragment the span and over-strip. Double-quote /
backtick / code / blockquote stripping covers the realistic mention forms.

Pure stdlib, no imports beyond re. Fail-open is the caller's job (a caller that
cannot read the transcript passes "" and gets False).
