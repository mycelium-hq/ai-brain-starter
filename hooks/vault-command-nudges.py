PreToolUse Bash hook: vault-wide command nudges + blocks.

Adapted from anthropics/claude-code examples/hooks/bash_command_validator_example.py.

Enforces CLAUDE.md rules that were codified but not hook-blocked:
- Blocks `git push` against a local-only vault repo (no remote configured)
- Blocks unscoped `git status` against a vault repo (full-tree walk)
- Blocks `rm -rf` against a vault root or any of its top-level folders
- Nudges `grep` -> Grep tool / rg, `find -name` -> Glob tool

Three scoping models, tagged per rule:

- repo-scoped (git push / git status): fire ONLY when the git op targets
  a vault repo itself, or a worktree of it. Repo identity is resolved via
  `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, NOT a path-string prefix. A prefix
  mis-fires on a symlinked folder that LIVES inside the vault namespace
  but POINTS AT a separate repo -- one that has a remote and is a normal
  size, so pushing from it is fine and blocking it is a false positive.
  Targeting follows `git -C <dir>` and an explicit `git --git-dir <dir>`;
  the value-taking options (`-C`, `-c`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree`,
  `--namespace`) are matched WITH their separate-argument value, so a
  subcommand cannot hide behind the value or a quoted value's space.

- namespace-scoped (grep / find): fire whenever the command touches the
  vault path namespace (cwd under it, or the literal path in the
  command). The grep/find slow-walk concern is about the filesystem tree,
  not git, so these keep the path-prefix gate.

- target-scoped (rm -rf): parse the rm's OPERANDS, resolve each one
  against every candidate cwd, and fire only when a resolved target IS a
  vault root or a direct child of one. See _rm_verdicts.

WHAT THE GUARD CAN SEE comes first (every scoping model above is downstream
of it). Rules are matched PER SEGMENT against a quote-aware split, and each
segment is read through `_LEAD`, which absorbs transparent wrappers, one-shot
`VAR=` assignments and an explicit path to the binary. Matching a bare `git` /
`rm` token at a regex-alternation boundary instead let all of these run
completely unguarded, which no amount of correct cwd reasoning downstream can
recover:

    env git push        sudo git push        /usr/bin/git push
    FOO=bar git push    command git status   (git push)
    FOO=bar rm -rf <vault root>              /bin/rm -rf <vault root>

Escape hatch: prefix the command with VAULT_VALIDATOR_BYPASS=1, or export it
for the session. The inline form is scoped to the command it prefixes, not to
the whole line.

#      `rm -rf "/Users/x/Brain/<folder>"` -- the same deletion, spelled the way
