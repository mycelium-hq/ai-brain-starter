"""
migrate-to-user-level.py — SessionStart hook that detects project-level
installs of ai-brain-starter hooks and offers to migrate to user-level.

Why: project-level hooks (in <project>/.claude/settings.json or
.claude/settings.local.json) silently don't fire when cwd is inside
<project>/.claude/worktrees/<name>/. User-level hooks
(~/.claude/settings.json) fire universally.

Behavior:
  - Fires once per session (SessionStart).
  - Detects ai-brain-starter hooks at project level via fingerprint.
  - If detected AND user-level install is missing the same fingerprint,
    injects a one-paragraph context message offering migration.
  - Fires AT MOST ONCE PER VAULT (state file at ~/.claude/.abs-migration-state.json).
  - Easy opt-out: `migrationDeclined: true` in CLAUDE.md frontmatter.

The migration itself is performed by scripts/install-hooks-user-level.py
(the user runs it once they accept; this hook only surfaces the prompt).

Performance: <100ms.
