"""
first-week-checkin.py — SessionStart hook for new-user stewardship.

Closes the day-3 / day-7 / day-14 dropout cliff. Phase 24 hands strangers off,
but Wes Kao's panel critique was correct: cohort-style courses lose 30-40% of
at-risk users in days 2-7 if there's no asynchronous check-in surface.

This hook fires on SessionStart, computes days-since-install, and on day 3,
day 7, and day 14 injects a one-paragraph "how's it going?" prompt that:
  - Surfaces 1-2 specific suggestions based on what skills haven't been tried
    (read from skill-usage telemetry if available, fall back to generic hints)
  - Asks one open question
  - Fires AT MOST ONCE per milestone (state file guards re-firing)
  - Easy opt-out: `firstWeekCheckin: false` in CLAUDE.md frontmatter
    OR delete ~/.claude/.ai-brain-checkin-state.json

Install detection:
  - Looks for ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/.git for first-clone date
    OR ~/.claude/.ai-brain-installed-at marker (preferred)
  - If no marker AND no git repo, hook is a no-op

State file (~/.claude/.ai-brain-checkin-state.json):
  {
    "installed_at": "2026-04-30T...",
    "fired": ["day-3", "day-7", "day-14"]
  }

Performance: <50ms.
