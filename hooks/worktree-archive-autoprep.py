"""Auto-prep worktree before Claude Code's archive prompt scans git status.

Permanent fix for the false-alarm archive warning that flagged 7+
hookify files as "permanent loss" when they were byte-identical to
main.

Mechanism: registered as a `Stop` hook in ~/.claude/settings.json.
Fires after every assistant turn. Detects whether the current working
directory is inside a vault worktree
(`<vault>/.claude/worktrees/<slug>/`); if so, invokes the existing
`worktree-archive-prep.py` script from the main vault path, which
removes byte-identical untracked duplicates and clears byte-identical
modified-file entries.

Idempotent — short-circuits silently when there's nothing to clean.
No-op when not in a worktree (most sessions).

Why a Stop hook (not SessionEnd):
- Stop fires on every assistant response, so the worktree stays
  clean continuously throughout the session.
- The archive prompt the harness shows when the user clicks
  "archive worktree" scans `git status` in real time. If we only
  cleaned at SessionEnd, there'd be a window where the user could
  click archive between turns and still see the false alarm.
- Stop fires often, so the script must short-circuit fast.
  worktree-archive-prep.py exits 0 silently when 0 untracked + 0
  modified, so the cost is one git status call per assistant turn.

Bypass: WORKTREE_AUTOPREP_BYPASS=1 in env if the prep itself misbehaves.

Codified 2026-05-09 after the false alarm fired across multiple
sessions despite Phase 2c (worktree-archive-prep) running at session
close. The Phase 2c run cleared the duplicates, then the worktree's
git status got recomputed (session resume / branch sync) and the same
false alarm re-fired. Stop-hook continuous cleanup closes that gap.
