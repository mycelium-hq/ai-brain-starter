"""Session turn counter — Stop hook.

Per CLAUDE.md / efficiency.md Rule 55: long sessions degrade quality (Microsoft
DELEGATE-52: ~25% corruption over 20 edits, amplified 5x by document size). The
60-exchange force-close threshold is quality-preserving, not just cost-preserving.

Counts assistant turns per session_id. State at /tmp/claude-turn-count-{session_id}.json.

  Turn 50  -> warn via systemMessage
  Turn 60+ -> hard-flag, recommend handoff file at ⚙️ Meta/Handoffs/<slug>.md
  Otherwise silent.

Bypass: TURN_COUNTER_BYPASS=1 in env.
