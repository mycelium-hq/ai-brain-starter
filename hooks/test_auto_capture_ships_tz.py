"""auto-capture-public-ships must IMPORT and run to completion with no timezone set.

The hook shipped with

    TZ = ZoneInfo("America/user-local-tz")

an unsubstituted template placeholder that is not an IANA key. Nothing in the
repo ever substituted it, so `ZoneInfo()` raised ZoneInfoNotFoundError at MODULE
IMPORT -- before main() was ever reached. The SessionEnd hook exited 1 on every
machine it was ever installed on and captured exactly zero ships, for its whole
life. No test ran this hook at all, which is the only reason an import-time
crash could survive that long: there is no partial run to notice, no half-written
file, no wrong answer. The hook simply was not there.

So the load-bearing assertion here is the cheapest one imaginable -- run the
thing and look at the exit code. That is the test that was missing.

Covered:
  1. no $VAULT_TZ            -> exit 0, parseable JSON  (the original crash)
  2. $VAULT_TZ = the literal placeholder -> exit 0, degrades to local
  3. $VAULT_TZ = a real zone -> honoured  (skipped where no tz database exists)
  4. bypass flag             -> exit 0
  5. CLASS guard: no hook may call ZoneInfo() at module level, since that is
     precisely what turns a bad/absent zone into an import-time death. This repo
     is a TEMPLATE that gets synced into installs, so the placeholder class can
     come back the same way it arrived.
  6. negative control proving (5) actually trips -- a guard nobody has watched
     fail is not known to work.
