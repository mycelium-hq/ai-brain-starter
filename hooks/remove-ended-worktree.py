"""Remove the just-ended session's scratch worktree — the event-driven fix
for git-worktree pileup.

THE BUG THIS FIXES
------------------
Stock Claude Code creates a fresh worktree under `.claude/worktrees/<slug>/`
per session but never removes it. The weekly prune script only deletes
*branches* whose worktree dir is already gone — nothing removes the DIRECTORY.
So worktrees accumulate, each a full vault checkout, until a cloud-sync daemon
(iCloud/OneDrive/Dropbox) or the disk falls over (observed: 102 worktrees /
1.29M files / ~25GB). Scheduled cleanup of an unbounded resource is the
anti-pattern; this removes each worktree at the moment its session ends.

SAFETY (see _lib/worktree_safety.py for the full guarantee)
-----------------------------------------------------------
  * Only acts on `claude/<slug>` SCRATCH branches — never a deliberate
    feature-branch worktree you created on purpose.
  * Snapshots any genuinely-unsaved content (not in git's object DB) to
    `⚙️ Meta/Worktree Snapshots/<slug>/` first. If ANY such file can't be
    copied, REFUSES to delete (fail safe).
  * `git worktree remove` keeps the branch ref, so committed work survives.
  * Runs LAST in the SessionEnd chain (after reconcile/scrub) so it doesn't
    pull the rug from under sibling hooks.

Bypass: KEEP_WORKTREE_ON_END=1  (keep every worktree — opt back into manual cleanup)

WIRING (SessionEnd, last):
  "SessionEnd": [
    {"hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/remove-ended-worktree.py 2>/dev/null || echo '{\"continue\":true,\"suppressOutput\":true}'"
    }]}
  ]
Pairs with snapshot-pending-work-on-stop.py (Stop) and enforce-worktree-cap.py
(SessionStart, backstop for sessions that crash before SessionEnd fires).
