"""SessionStart hook: nudge /sunday-review on Sundays.

Reads `<vault>/⚙️ Meta/skill-usage-log.jsonl` and emits a nudge to
stderr (which Claude Code SessionStart hooks treat as injected context)
only when:

  1. Today is Sunday (weekday() == 6)
  2. No `sunday-review` or `insights` skill invocation is present in the
     skill-usage log within the last 6 days

Vault root resolution order:
  1. SUNDAY_NUDGE_VAULT env var (explicit override)
  2. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR env var (set by Claude Code in CWD-aware contexts)

If neither is set, the hook silently no-ops (avoids accidental fires
in a project that does not have a vault).

Bypass: SUNDAY_NUDGE_BYPASS=1
Skill log location override: SUNDAY_NUDGE_LOG_PATH
