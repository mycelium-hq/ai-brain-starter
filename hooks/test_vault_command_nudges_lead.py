"""Controls for vault-command-nudges.py's command-recognition layer (_LEAD).

Every BLOCK case here was measured EXITING 0 -- silently unguarded -- against
the revision this suite landed with. The rm rule had been generalised to
multi-vault targeting, but the push / status / grep / find rules still matched a
bare `git` / `rm` token at a regex-alternation boundary, and the cwd walk was a
quote-blind `re.split`. So a transparent wrapper, a one-shot `VAR=` assignment,
an explicit path to the binary, a subshell, or a `cd` hidden inside a quoted
string was enough to walk straight past all four.

The ALLOW legs are not decoration. A guard that over-blocks teaches people to
reach for the bypass, and the fail-closed cwd candidate SET introduced alongside
_LEAD is exactly the kind of change that over-blocks. Every BLOCK leg is paired
with an ALLOW leg that must stay allowed, so a hook that simply returned 2 for
everything would fail this suite rather than pass it.

Fixtures are built here, not borrowed from the developer's machine: a vault is
"a directory with a Meta-suffixed folder above it" (hooks/_lib/vault_root.py),
so a tmpdir with `Meta/` and a `git init` is a real one. VAULT_ROOT is pointed
somewhere ELSE on purpose -- these rules must resolve the vault PER TARGET, and
pointing the env var at the fixture would let a regression that only ever reads
$VAULT_ROOT pass.

Stdlib only. Exit 0 = all pass.
