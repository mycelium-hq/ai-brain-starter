Stop hook: blocks responses that CLAIM to close the session without actually
running the FULL cascade (session file + session-close-runner.sh report).

Failure modes this prevents:
  - 2026-05-10 busy-pasteur: model wrote summary saying "closing the session"
    but never ran Phase 0-3 of ⚙️ Meta/rules/session-close.md.
  - 2026-05-11 gallant-kalam: model wrote session file + committed it, then
    posted a "## Session ... — final summary" message claiming closure
    without running session-close-runner.sh (aggregators, Phase 0c-e,
    worktree-settle). the user flagged: "this keeps happening, make the fix
    permanent."

Three-gate check when a closing claim is detected:
  1. Session file exists at <meta>/Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD*<worktree>*.md
  2. session-close-runner.sh ran in the last 30 min — verified via
     /tmp/abs-session-close-runner.report ending in `RUNNER COMPLETE @ <ts>`.
  3. No uncommitted session-close artifacts (today's Sessions/Decisions/
     Captures files must be staged + committed via vault-safe-commit.sh).

All three must be true. Two-gate version was the 2026-05-12 funny-golick
gap: session file existed, runner ran, but 5 files (session + 3 decisions
+ Captures + to-do append) sat uncommitted until the worktree archive
prompt caught them. Permanent-fix-pattern: don't rely on user-visible UI
warnings; block at the model layer.

Spanish closing patterns added 2026-05-13 — the same session's goodbye
("Que descanses, Ade") slipped past the English-only regex, so the
three-gate check never even fired.

2026-06-30: VAULT_ROOT is now resolved repo-aware (see _lib/vault_root.py),
in lockstep with detect-closing-signal.py. Before this fix, VAULT_ROOT was
read straight from the env var — permanently, for every repo, whenever a
machine-wide default was configured. A session working inside its own
vault-shaped repo (own CLAUDE.md, own Session End/Close cascade) had its
session file correctly written there by detect-closing-signal.py's own
repo-aware fix, but THIS hook still checked the unrelated default vault's
Sessions/ dir and runner state — turning a silent mis-filing into an
active false hard-block quoting the wrong vault's missing files.

FAIL-SAFE / conditional enforcement (so this hook is safe to wire by
default for every vault):
  - The hard-block (exit 2) is gated on the session-close cascade actually
    being INSTALLED in this vault — i.e. <meta>/scripts/session-close-runner.sh
    exists. If it does NOT, the vault never opted into the cascade and the
    hook NEVER blocks; it degrades to a non-blocking advisory. This prevents
    the "missing runner blocks every close forever" failure: gate 2 can only
    fire against a runner that is actually present to run.
  - When the runner IS installed, the user has opted into the close
    machinery, so all three gates get teeth.

Bypass / overrides:
  - VERIFY_CASCADE_BYPASS=1  — skip the check entirely (no block, no advisory).
  - VERIFY_CASCADE_SOFT=1    — force advisory mode even when the runner is
                               installed (warn, never block).
