"""SessionStart hook: surface automation runners that have been failing silently.

The 191-file strand of 2026-05-14 happened because auto-snapshot.sh had been
failing every hour for 48+ hours without anyone noticing. The fix has two
layers:

  1. The script itself unstages on failure (auto-snapshot.sh v4, 2026-05-14).
  2. THIS hook surfaces persistent failures at the next session start so
     they can't go undetected for weeks again.

Scans known runner logs for FAIL/ERROR entries in the last 72 hours. If any
runner shows >= threshold failures in window, emit a SystemMessage at session
start. Stays silent when nothing is wrong.

Bypass: SURFACE_STALE_AUTOMATION_BYPASS=1 in env.

Codified 2026-05-14 as the meta-fix for the stranded-files class.
