"""SessionStart hook: surface automation runners that have been failing silently.

The 191-file strand of 2026-05-14 happened because auto-snapshot.sh had been
failing every hour for 48+ hours without anyone noticing. The fix has two
layers:

  1. The script itself unstages on failure (auto-snapshot.sh v4, 2026-05-14).
  2. THIS hook surfaces persistent failures at the next session start so
     they can't go undetected for weeks again.

Scans known runner logs for FAIL/ERROR entries in the last 72 hours. If any
runner shows >= threshold failures in window, emit a SystemMessage at session
start. Stays silent when nothing is wrong.

Bypass: SURFACE_STALE_AUTOMATION_BYPASS=1 in env.

Codified 2026-05-14 as the meta-fix for the stranded-files class.

    column = not currently running (irrelevant to this check). Measured
    2026-08-20: a job launchd has REGISTERED but has NEVER EXECUTED also
    reads 0 in this column — byte-identical to a genuinely healthy job. That
    blind spot let a dead job sit unnoticed for days with real downstream
    damage — this function used to treat status 0 as simply "clean", which
    is exactly the misread.

    So status 0 is now AMBIGUOUS, not clean, and is disambiguated by a
    second, slower probe: `_launchd_print_liveness()`, whose `runs` field is
    0 only when the job has truly never run. That is reported as a DISTINCT
    "hollow" finding, because the remedy differs — a hollow job needs
    `bootout` + `bootstrap` (reload it), a failing job needs its error log
    read. A non-zero status is unambiguous already (you cannot have a real
    exit code without having executed) and is flagged directly, exactly as
    before, with no extra probe.

    The print probe is bounded three ways so this stays fast at every

    narrowed to "mine, loaded, status==0"; (2) capped at
    MAX_LAUNCHD_PRINT_PROBES total calls per run; (3) each call carries its
    own short timeout. Any failure of the probe itself — `launchctl print`
    unavailable, non-zero exit, timeout, unparseable output, no UID — silently
    degrades that label to the pre-probe reading (not flagged), never raises.

    This auto-covers every job — including ones not in RUNNERS, the gap that
    let a health-check and a reconcile job fail unnoticed. Restricted to
    labels the user installed (see user_launchd_labels), so the machine's

    The generic RUNNERS pass uses a 3-failures-in-72h threshold tuned for the
    hourly auto-snapshot job. The daily 18:00 broadcast fails intermittently
    (a claude-router auth blip, a venv break) and never trips 3-in-72h, so it
    slipped past silently for 10 days. That gap is why "I'm not seeing the
    daily updates" surfaced (2026-05-22). A daily job needs last-run-outcome
    detection: one failed run is one lost broadcast.

    Reads the LAST exit code per workspace from the append-only log. Surfaces
    a finding only while the most recent run for a workspace is still failed,
    so a recovered failure self-clears instead of nagging for 72h. Also flags
    the cron going stale (no run in 48h).
