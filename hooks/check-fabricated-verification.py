"""Stop hook. Block fabricated VERIFICATION claims in the final assistant turn.

An agent's closing message must not assert a state it never confirmed with a
tool call. Three detectors, each fails OPEN (a guard that crash-blocks Stop is
worse than the bug it catches). Evidence = NON-assistant transcript records
(tool_result outputs) + the commands actually executed (tool_use inputs). The
model cannot self-verify from its own prose.

  A. ORPHAN EVIDENCE ID — a deploy/build/run-ID- or commit-SHA-shaped token,
     presented inside backticks in a verification context, that appears in ZERO
     executed commands AND ZERO tool outputs this session. A fabricated ID is,
     by definition, nowhere in the evidence.

  B. CLAIMED-CHECK-WITHOUT-TOOL — an HTTP/curl status claim with no HTTP-fetch
     tool (curl/wget/httpie/WebFetch) executed, OR a deploy-confirmation claim
     with no deploy command (netlify/fly/vercel/deploy.sh) executed.

  C. EXTERNAL-STATE-LANDED — a claim that git/PR state has LANDED on a shared
     surface (pushed / on origin / synced / PR opened / PR merged) with no
     read of the system of record for that surface. "Committed" and "pushed"
     are separate claims: a commit is local; only a remote read (`git
     rev-parse origin/<branch>`, `git ls-remote`, `git fetch`) proves origin
     moved, and only `gh pr view --json headRefOid,state` (or `gh pr
     list`/`gh pr checks`) proves a PR exists or merged. This closes the
     failure mode where a chained `git push && gh pr create` is truncated by
     `tail`, an early step's gate-denial hides in the cut output, and the
     agent reports the whole chain as landed from the mutating command alone
     instead of reading the remote back.

Forensic exemption: a match within +-110 chars of a negation/postmortem word
(didn't, did not, never, no tool call, without running, fabricat, hallucinat,
claim-before-verify, would have) is skipped, so honest writeups pass. A
not-yet-happened match (will push, about to push, ready to push, once this is
merged, need to push) is also skipped, so plans and TODOs pass.
