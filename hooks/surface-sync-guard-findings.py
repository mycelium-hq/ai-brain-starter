"""SessionStart: surface the sync-folder guard's LAST verdict.

WHY THIS EXISTS: detection was never the gap — ROUTING was. In the field the
guard ran daily for three months and correctly reported a dozen git repos
churning inside a cloud-synced folder on every single run. Its only sink was a
log file, so nothing changed until a human happened to run it by hand. A guard
whose findings land somewhere nobody opens is indistinguishable from no guard.
Bug class GUARD-REPORTS-INTO-A-LOG-NOBODY-READS.

BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION: this reads one small JSON snapshot written by the
scheduled scan. It must NEVER re-walk the cloud roots. Per-session work that
scales with user data becomes N concurrent full walks under N sessions, which
is the very resource storm the guard exists to prevent.

Also reports STALENESS: a snapshot that stopped updating means the scheduled job
died, and a dead guard and a clean one otherwise emit identical silence.

Advisory only, always exits 0. Bypass: SYNC_GUARD_SURFACE_BYPASS=1
