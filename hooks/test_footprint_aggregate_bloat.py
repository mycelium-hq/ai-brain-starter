"""Negative + positive controls for the AGGREGATE bloat-dir signal (MYC-577).

The bug this closes: `worktree-footprint-signal.py` observed worktree COUNT
only, so the non-worktree half of the 2026-06-06 ~234K-file melt (.smart-env
regrowth above all) was invisible until the machine fell over. A signal that
silently stopped covering the aggregate looks exactly like a healthy machine,
so the controls here assert BOTH directions:

  * over threshold with ZERO worktrees          -> fires, names the dir, gives a remedy
  * under threshold                             -> silent
  * a dir added via WORKTREE_FOOTPRINT_BLOAT_DIRS -> counted
  * second run inside the TTL                   -> reuses the cache (no re-walk)
  * cached over-threshold reading                -> STILL warns (the cap bounds
    the walk, not the signal — a capped signal that goes quiet between walks
    would reintroduce the invisible-until-catastrophic failure)
  * symlink out of the tree                     -> not followed (the vault
    commonly links back out; following turns a bounded walk into a cycle)
