"""PreToolUse(Bash) warn. Two mirror shapes in which a pipe hides a failure.

A. A state-changing command AFTER `&&`, with the pipeline piped to `tail`/`head`.
B. A VERIFICATION GATE (typecheck / test / lint / build) piped to `tail`/`head`
   BEFORE `&&`. A pipeline exits with its LAST command's status, so `tail`
   returns 0 over a failing gate and `&&` runs the rest as though it passed.
   The truncation compounds it by dropping the very line ("error TS…", "FAIL")
   a later grep would look for. Observed in the wild: a branch that did not
   compile was reported green across typecheck, lint and a full 4,600-test
   suite, because the test runner strips types and never typechecks, so the
   passing tests said nothing about compilation.

That exact shape hides failure. `&&` short-circuits, so an early step's denial
or error kills the rest of the chain — and `tail -3` then shows only the last
few lines, which are the ERROR text of whichever step died. The agent reads a
plausible-looking tail, infers every earlier step succeeded, and reports the
whole chain as landed. Nothing in the visible output says otherwise.

Warn only, never block: the shape is often legitimate (a long build piped to
`tail` for brevity). The point is to make the agent read the exit status and
re-read the remote instead of trusting the tail. The Stop-side guard
(check-fabricated-verification.py, Detector C) is what actually enforces the
read-of-record before a landed-state claim.
