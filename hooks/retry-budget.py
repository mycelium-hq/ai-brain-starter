"""
PreToolUse Bash hook: retry budget.

Blocks the 4th invocation of an identical Bash command within 30 minutes.
Claude loops on failing commands and burns context; this hook forces an
escape at 3 attempts so the blocker gets surfaced to the user.

Bypass: prefix command with RETRY_BUDGET_BYPASS=1 when intentionally
re-running (polling a cron, expected retries, iteration on a fix where
each attempt is a real change).

State: /tmp/claude-retry-budget-{session_id}.json keyed by md5(norm_cmd).
Window: 30 min rolling. Commands <15 chars exempt (ls, pwd, date, etc.).

Pattern inspired by Devin 2.0 ("ask user for help if CI does not pass
after the third attempt") and Cursor 2.0 ("don't loop more than 3 times
to fix linter errors").
