## Phase 2: Install Obsidian Plugins

**AUTO-INSTALL FIRST. Don't make the user click through Obsidian's plugin browser unless the auto-install fails.** Non-technical users miss-click in the plugin UI, install the wrong plugin, or skip the "Enable" step after "Install" — these are the top three Phase 2 support requests.

Tell the user: *"I'm going to install your Obsidian plugins in the background. These power live queries, templates, task tracking, and AI-powered note linking. Give me a few seconds."*

Then run this Python helper, substituting `[VAULT_PATH]` with the actual vault path saved in Phase 1 step 8:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'

VAULT = Path("[VAULT_PATH]")
OBSIDIAN_DIR = VAULT / ".obsidian"
PLUGINS_DIR = OBSIDIAN_DIR / "plugins"
PLUGINS_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Plugin id → GitHub repo (owner/repo). The release ZIP for each contains
# main.js, manifest.json, and (sometimes) styles.css — Obsidian's plugin format.
PLUGINS = {
    "dataview":  "blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview",

**After the script runs — read the output carefully before doing anything:**
- `= plugin already installed` → **success, do nothing.** This means the plugin was already present. Do NOT re-run, do NOT tell the user to install it manually, do NOT flag it as a problem. Already installed is the ideal state.
- `+ plugin installed` → freshly installed, success.
- `! plugin install failed: ...` → genuine failure (network error, GitHub rate limit, etc.). Fall back to the manual UI walkthrough for ONLY this plugin.
- `Done. Installed X/Y plugins.` at the end → if X equals Y, everything succeeded (including pre-existing ones). Move on.

**Do not retry a plugin that printed `= already installed`.** Do not ask the user to check it. Do not loop back. It's done.

- If all plugins are `=` or `+`: tell the user *"Done — all plugins are installed. If Obsidian is open right now, close and reopen it (or press Cmd+R / Ctrl+R) so they activate."*
- If any plugin failed (`!`): fall back to the manual UI walkthrough for ONLY the failed plugins.
- If the auto-install fails entirely (no Python, no network, vault path wrong): fall back to the full manual UI walkthrough below.

**Manual fallback (only if auto-install failed):**

"Now let's install the plugins that make everything work. In Obsidian: Settings → Community Plugins → Turn on community plugins → Browse."

Walk them through installing and enabling each one:

1. **Dataview** — "Search 'Dataview' → Install → Enable. Powers live queries and dashboards."
2. **Templater** — "Search 'Templater' → Install → Enable. Auto-applies templates when you create notes."
3. **Tasks** — "Search 'Tasks' → Install → Enable. Tracks to-dos across your vault."
4. **Smart Connections** — "Search 'Smart Connections' → Install → Enable. AI-powered note linking, finds connections you'd miss."
5. **Local REST API** — "Search 'Local REST API' → Install → Enable. Lets Claude interact with your vault directly."

"All installed and enabled? Let's keep going."

## Phase 3: Create Folder Structure

"I'm going to create your folder structure now. This is how your vault will be organized."

**BEFORE CREATING ANYTHING — check what already exists.** The user may have already organized their vault. Scan the top-level folder first. If a folder already exists (even with a slightly different name), use it — don't create a duplicate. If a file was manually moved since setup, respect its new location. Claude's idea of "where something should go" is always subordinate to where it actually is right now. This prevents the most common setup complaint: Claude recreating files the user already moved.

Create these CORE folders in their vault (emojis are important — they make the sidebar scannable):

```
📓 Journals/
📓 Journals/Monthly Summaries/
📓 Journals/Weekly Insights/
📓 Journals/Monthly Insights/
🏠 Home/
👤 CRM/
📝 Notes/
⚙️ Meta/
⚙️ Meta/scripts/
```

**Conditional folders — only create if relevant based on what they told you in Phase 1. These are BLOCKING conditionals, not suggestions. If the user did not explicitly opt in, DO NOT create the folder, DO NOT add it to the vault map, DO NOT reference it in their CLAUDE.md or resolver files.**

- `✍️ Writing/` — **ONLY if `WRITES_PUBLICLY = true` from Phase 1 question 5.** Journaling does NOT count (that's `📓 Journals/`). This folder is for content written with an audience in mind: blog posts, book drafts, newsletters, Substack, essays. If the user said no or was unclear, **skip this folder entirely**. Do not create `Writing/Drafts/`, do not add "Writing/" to the `⚙️ Meta/Folder Resolvers/📝 Notes.md` decision tree, do not add writing-related rules to the Phase 4 CLAUDE.md template, do not reference Writing/ anywhere downstream. The default state for a new user is: no Writing folder.
- `📚 Books/` — **ONLY if they read books and highlight/annotate.** Ask in Phase 1 or infer from their answer about existing notes. If they mention Kindle, Readwise, book notes, or reading habits, create it. Otherwise skip. Most people don't need an empty Books folder sitting in their sidebar.
- `🧠 Psychology/` — **ONLY if they explicitly mention inner work, therapy, self-help, psychology, behavioral patterns, or personal development as a focus area.** This is a niche folder. Most people's reflections live naturally in Journals/ and Notes/. Don't create it by default.
- `💼 Business/` — only if they have a business, startup, or side project
- `✅ To-dos/` — **ONLY if they want task management inside the vault.** Some people prefer external tools (Todoist, Things, Linear). If they say yes or mention wanting to track tasks: create the folder, then install the to-do system from `templates/generated/todo-system-template.md`. This gives them a two-file setup (prioritized queue + capture inbox), an Eisenhower four-quadrant Dataview view rendered at the top of the queue so top priorities are visible every time they open the file, P1/P2/P3 tiers with Dataview inline fields, an auto-refreshing This Week view, and a Waiting On tracker. If they already have a task system they like, skip it.
- `🚀 [Project Name]/` — if they have an active project/startup, give it its own emoji folder
- `🏫 School/` — only if they're a student
- `🌱 Curiosities/` — for people who want a catch-all for random interests

**Why this matters:** previously, Writing/ was created by default for almost everyone because the conditional was too weak. The result was vaults with empty Writing folders for users who don't write, and Claude trying to create drafts in folders that shouldn't exist. Fix: require explicit opt-in.

Tell them: "Done — you should see the folders in your Obsidian sidebar now. The emojis help you scan quickly. If you have a specific area of your life that needs its own folder (a creative project, school, etc.), tell me and I'll add it."

**Add any custom folders they request. Always use emojis.**

### Phase 3b — Create About Me profile file

After creating folders, copy the About Me template into the vault's 🏠 Home/ folder:

```bash
mkdir -p "[VAULT_PATH]/🏠 Home"
cp "$HOME/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/templates/Home/About Me.md" "[VAULT_PATH]/🏠 Home/About Me.md"
# Substitute the {{DATE}} placeholder with today's date
sed -i '' "s/{{DATE}}/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/g" "[VAULT_PATH]/🏠 Home/About Me.md"
```

This is the canonical "deep profile" file. The CLAUDE.md `## Me` line is the quick reference loaded every session; `About Me.md` is the rich profile loaded on demand for context-heavy work (panel reviews, life-history prose, advisory sessions, weekly insights).

**Sections start mostly empty.** Phase 4 fills the high-priority fields (Identity name, Work one-liner, Relationships key people). Phase 11 fills Tools-adjacent fields. Phase 13 fills Health (wearables + labs link). Every subsequent session appends new personal context revealed during conversation per the universal capture rule below.

### Phase 3c — Universal capture rule (codified, applies for the rest of install AND every future session)

**Anything personal the user reveals must land somewhere durable in the vault before the conversation moves on.** If the user volunteers a fact about themselves — age, where they grew up, a health condition, a partner's name, an old job, a hobby, a value, a fear — and that fact does not naturally fit a structured ask currently running, append it to `🏠 Home/About Me.md` in the right section (or under `## Notes` if no section fits) before moving on.

The failure mode: a user says "I have ADHD" in passing during the tools question. The model nods and moves on. The fact never lands anywhere. Six months later when the user asks "why am I forgetting things?" the model has no context. The capture must be lossless.

**Mechanics:**
- Append, never overwrite. Date the addition if it's a free-form `## Notes` entry.
- Place in the right section if obvious (health → Health, family → Relationships, etc.).
- Do not pause the conversation to confirm — just write the bullet and continue. The user can edit/remove later.
- If the fact contradicts something already in About Me (old version), surface the conflict to the user: "You said [old]; just now you said [new]. Which should stay?" Do not silently overwrite.
- Sensitive content (trauma, medical, financial in private repos) is fine to append. About Me is the user's private vault file, not shared.

This rule applies to EVERY phase from here forward and to every post-install session. It is the canonical answer to "information was given and went nowhere."

After creating folders, create resolver files in `⚙️ Meta/Folder Resolvers/` — one per key directory. Each is a short decision tree answering "does X live here?" — it prevents the vault from decaying into ambiguity as it grows. Centralized in Meta so the resolver doesn't clutter the folder it describes (a resolver file sitting in `👤 CRM/` shows up in every CRM Dataview query and next to every contact card).

First create the `⚙️ Meta/Folder Resolvers/` directory, then create these files inside it. Name each file after the folder it describes (use the folder's emoji prefix):

**⚙️ Meta/Folder Resolvers/👤 CRM.md:**
```markdown
# Does this live in CRM/?

1. Is this a real person you've interacted with or plan to? → YES: create [Name].md there
2. Is it a company, org, or brand (not a specific person)? → NO: Business/ or Notes/
3. Is it a public figure you've never met? → NO: Notes/ or Books/
4. Is it a group you have a relationship with as a whole? → YES, if you interact with them as a unit
```

**⚙️ Meta/Folder Resolvers/📝 Notes.md:**
```markdown
# Does this live in Notes/?

1. Is this from a book you read and the user has a 📚 Books/ folder? → NO: 📚 Books/. (Omit this line if no Books/ folder exists.)
2. Is this a psychology/behavioral concept and the user has a 🧠 Psychology/ folder? → Maybe: 🧠 Psychology/. (Omit this line if no Psychology/ folder exists.)
3. Is this an article, course, or how-to you learned from? → YES: create here
4. Is this a concept that belongs to a specific project? → NO: that project's folder
5. Is this your own original framework or thesis? → If short/raw, it can stay here or in a journal. If you're developing it into something longer, put it wherever your creative work lives. (Only mention `Writing/` here if the user has a `✍️ Writing/` folder — otherwise omit the whole sentence about drafts. Don't reference folders that don't exist in this user's vault.)
```
