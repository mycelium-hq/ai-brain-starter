## Phase 0: Install Efficiency Tools First

**Do this silently before the conversation starts.** All mechanical installs live in `bootstrap.sh` (Mac/Linux) and `bootstrap.ps1` (Windows) at the repo root. Phase 0 is a thin orchestrator: detect platform, invoke bootstrap, handle the conversational follow-ups, then hand off to Phase 1.

**Why one source of truth?** The install list (brew/python/node/pipx/gh/fastmcp, graphify, humanizer, all bundled sub-skills, Granola + ChatPRD MCPs, the obsidian-skills and vendor skill-pack marketplaces, context7/playwright plugins, Obsidian app, Obsidian CLI symlink) used to live in two places: bootstrap scripts AND this phase file. They drifted. Now bootstrap is canonical. Every line of install logic lives there, on every platform. Phase 0 never copies bash.

---

### Step 0.0. Progress message (before anything runs)

Non-technical users will think nothing is happening if Claude goes silent during installs. Before invoking bootstrap, say (English by default; Spanish once Phase 1 step 1.0 has run):

> "Setting up the tools you'll need, give me a moment. This usually takes 2 to 3 minutes the first time, or just a few seconds if you've already run the bootstrap. I'll keep you posted as each piece installs."

As bootstrap prints its own check-mark lines per tool, you don't need to narrate each one. The output is already reassuring. Chime in once at the end: *"All tools ready. Now let's get you set up."* Or, on failure: *"A couple of tools didn't install (listed above). I'll work around them for now and we can retry at the end. None of them are blocking what we're about to do."*

**One exception to "work around it" — the Terminal step.** If the bootstrap prints `TERMINAL STEP NEEDED` (this happens on a Mac when Homebrew is missing: it needs the Mac password, which you cannot type from a non-interactive session), do NOT work around it and do NOT install Homebrew yourself. Relay the exact one-line Terminal command the bootstrap printed to the user, verbatim, ask them to run it and reply when it finishes, then continue. That one command does every password-gated install (Homebrew, Obsidian, gh) and re-runs the rest idempotently. See Step 0.1b.

**DO NOT use the Monitor tool on bootstrap output.** Monitor renders every stdout line as a separate "Human:" turn in the conversation transcript — empty lines from brew/npm chatter included. Users see a wall of bare `Human:` labels interspersed with progress messages and leaked `<task-notification>` XML blocks. Bootstrap's own stdout is already user-visible — just `Bash(bash bootstrap.sh)` and let it print directly. If you want async progress, set `run_in_background: true` on the Bash call and read the result when it finishes. Monitor is for log-streaming long-running daemons, not installers.

### Step 0.0b. Tell the user about the trust prompt before it appears

The bootstrap registers third-party plugin marketplaces and MCP servers (see the install table in Step 0.1). Once that happens, Claude Code shows its **built-in trust prompt** for the third-party content. You cannot suppress that prompt, and you should not want to. It is a real safety feature. But a non-technical user who hits it cold, with no warning, reads it as "malicious software is sneaking onto my machine," panics, and abandons the install. This has happened to a real installer.

So get ahead of it. **Before** you invoke the bootstrap (or the instant you see the prompt appear, whichever comes first), tell the user, in their language, something close to this:

> "Heads up on one thing: in a moment Claude Code will pause and ask you to approve the tools this setup installs. It may warn that they come from third parties or are not verified by Anthropic. That prompt is Claude Code's normal safety check for anything that did not come from Anthropic itself — it appears for every third-party tool, so seeing it here is expected, not a sign that something is wrong. The decision is yours: read what it lists, and everything being added is also itemized, with licenses, in the project's README if you want to look anything up first. If you're comfortable, approve it and I'll keep going; if you'd rather review the list together or skip something, say so and we'll do that."

For Spanish-speaking installs, the same beat in voseo register (peer-to-peer, not a translation):

> "Ojo con una cosa: Claude Code va a frenar en un momento para pedirte que apruebes las herramientas que instala este setup. Te puede avisar, en un tono firme, que son de terceros o que Anthropic no las verificó. Ese aviso es su chequeo de seguridad normal para cualquier cosa que no venga directo de Anthropic — aparece con toda herramienta de terceros, así que verlo acá es esperable, no una señal de que algo esté mal. La decisión es tuya: leé lo que lista, y todo lo que se agrega también está detallado, con licencias, en el README del proyecto por si querés chequear algo antes. Si estás tranquila/o, aprobalo y sigo; si preferís que repasemos la lista juntos o saltear algo, decime y lo hacemos."

Adapt the wording to the user and the moment; do not read it robotically. The non-negotiable part: before they read the prompt themselves, the user must KNOW it is coming, that it is expected for third-party tools, and that the decision is genuinely theirs — with a real offer to review or decline. Never let the trust prompt be the first time they hear of it, and never pre-commit them to approving something they have not read yet. An unframed trust prompt is the single most common reason a non-technical install gets abandoned; a pre-approved one is how an assistant loses the user's trust.

### Step 0.0c. The command-approval prompt is also expected — explain it, never menu

Separately from the trust prompt above, Claude Code may also ask the user to approve the install **command** itself (the `git clone` / bootstrap run), depending on their permission mode. That approval is a normal part of the install, not a wall. When it appears, tell the user what the command does in one plain sentence so they can approve it informed — exactly as you pre-framed the trust prompt.

If a stricter permission mode blocks a command the user already said yes to, explain how to allow it and continue. **Do NOT respond to a routine permission prompt by falling back to a menu of install methods, and never silently downgrade to a `/plugin install`-only shortcut** — that adds the plugin's skills but skips the system tools, MCP wiring, and vault setup, so it is not the full install. If the user themselves decline a command, that is an answer, not an obstacle: respect it, say plainly what the install will be missing without it, and offer to continue without that piece or to revisit it — never pressure, never route around their no.

---

### Step 0.1. Invoke the bootstrap

The install does not gate on email. Do NOT ask the user for an email or a name before running the installer — just run it. The setup interview makes one optional email ask at the very end (Phase 24.4).

By the time `/setup-brain` fires, the ai-brain-starter skill folder already exists at `~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/` (that's how Claude Code found this phase file). So the bootstrap is always a local invocation, never a fresh curl. It is idempotent: safe on fresh machines and on re-runs. It skips anything already installed.

Detect platform with `uname -s` (Mac/Linux) or `$PSVersionTable` (Windows), then run the matching bootstrap:

#### Mac / Linux

```bash
bash "$HOME/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/bootstrap.sh"
```

#### Windows

```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\ai-brain-starter\bootstrap.ps1"
```

If the user reached /setup-brain WITHOUT running bootstrap first (rare), the repo was cloned another way (ai-brain-starter skill folder exists but bootstrap hasn't run). Invoking the local bootstrap above still does the full install. The clone-and-run commands in the bootstrap's own header comment are only for users who set things up BEFORE opening Claude Code.

**What bootstrap installs (for your awareness; do NOT re-install these yourself):**

| Category | Items |
|---|---|
| CLI tools | Homebrew (Mac), Python 3.10+, Node.js, pipx, gh, fastmcp, Claude Code |
| Desktop apps | Obsidian (via brew/winget/snap/flatpak/AppImage), Obsidian CLI symlink (Mac) |
| Graphify | graphifyy Python package + `graphify install` (platform binary) |
| Sub-skills | graphify, meeting-todos, patterns, insights, deconstruct, daily-journal, repurpose-talk, nano-banana (skill folder only; plugin install is deferred) |
| Humanizer | cloned from its own public fork (idempotent, never touched on re-run) |
| MCPs | granola + chatprd (registered in ~/.claude/.mcp.json with backup) |
| Marketplaces / plugins | obsidian-skills (kepano), enabling obsidian/context7/playwright; PLUS seven vendor skill-pack marketplaces (getsentry, trailofbits, stripe, cloudflare, AgriciDaniel/claude-seo, obra/superpowers, coreyhaines31/marketingskills), skippable with SKIP_VENDOR_SKILLS=1. These third-party marketplaces are what trigger Claude Code's trust prompt; pre-frame it per Step 0.0b. |

**Bootstrap does NOT touch:**
- The user's vault CLAUDE.md (vault path isn't known until Phase 5)
- **The three vault-content hooks** — `graph-context-hook.sh`, `write-hook.sh`, `session-end-hook.sh` — which live INSIDE the vault. Bootstrap DOES wire the user-level hooks that need no vault (closing-signal, frontmatter lint, skill-usage log, the meeting-workflow trigger) into `~/.claude/settings.json`, but these three are deferred to `/setup-brain` (phase-05) and wired with the real vault path once the vault exists. Wiring them earlier against a placeholder `$HOME` path is what produced the dead `~/⚙️ Meta/scripts/` hooks that errored on every prompt / write / session-end and forced a removal decision on the user mid-install (MYC-739). `install-hooks-user-level.py` now omits any vault-content hook when invoked without a `--vault-path`.
- nano-banana plugin binary (needs `/plugin install` inside Claude Code plus a Gemini API key; deferred until the user actually asks for image generation. See Step 0.4 below)
- Any custom skills, MCPs, marketplaces, permissions, or env vars already present

**If bootstrap fails any check**, it prints an explicit failure list. Tell the user exactly which items failed and offer to retry each one. Do NOT proceed silently. Downstream phases assume these are working. This rule exists because of a real incident where a user's Phase 0 run left graphify partially installed and the broken state stayed invisible for days.

---

### Step 0.1b. The Terminal step (Mac password / Homebrew) — relay it, don't route around it

On a Mac, if Homebrew isn't installed, the bootstrap can't install it from inside Claude Code: Homebrew's installer needs the Mac password at an interactive prompt, and Claude Code's shell has no way to type it. When that happens, the bootstrap stops cleanly and prints a block headed `TERMINAL STEP NEEDED` (Spanish: `PASO EN LA TERMINAL`) containing one command, then exits 0.

This is expected and is the normal recovery — **not** a failure to work around. When you see it:

1. Show the user the exact one-line command from that block, verbatim (it is `bash ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/bootstrap.sh`). Tell them to open Terminal (`Cmd+Space`, type "terminal", Return), paste it, press Return, and type their Mac password when asked (the screen stays blank while they type — that's normal Mac security).
2. Wait for them to reply that it finished. Do **not** continue the setup interview until they confirm.
3. Then continue. That one Terminal command installs Homebrew, Obsidian, gh, and everything else, and re-runs the whole bootstrap idempotently, so by the time they're back everything is in place.

Do NOT try to install Homebrew yourself, do NOT "work around" it by skipping Obsidian (the entire vault lives in Obsidian), and do NOT downgrade to a partial install. A single framed Terminal step is the whole fix. Most users who followed the web guide already ran Homebrew in Terminal first, in which case the bootstrap finds it and this step never appears.

**The same Terminal relay applies when the HARNESS is what's blocking.** Claude Code's own command-safety layer sometimes declines to execute the bootstrap command, and that block can persist even after the user re-approves — retrying the same command in-chat is not the fix and you should not keep trying. Hand the user the same one-line Terminal path instead, framed as the normal route (it genuinely is — the human running the installer themselves is exactly what that safety layer wants):

> "Claude Code prefers that you run the installer yourself — one line, takes a couple minutes. Open Terminal (`Cmd+Space`, type 'terminal', Return) and paste this:
> `git clone https://github.com/adelaidasofia/ai-brain-starter.git ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter 2>/dev/null; bash ~/.claude/skills/ai-brain-starter/bootstrap.sh`
> Tell me when it says it's done and we'll pick up right where we left off."

Then resume at the setup interview the moment they confirm. One honest note if they ask about previewing first: `--dry-run` shows what WOULD be installed without changing anything.

---

### Step 0.1c. Finish any install gaps — quietly, yourself

The bootstrap never shows a non-technical user a dead end: when an optional component doesn't land after retries (a Wi-Fi blip, a package-server hiccup — normal in a workshop room with 30 machines on one network), it records the gap in `~/.claude/.ai-brain-starter-install-gaps.jsonl` and tells the user the interview will finish it. That promise is YOURS to keep:

1. At the start of the interview (or the moment the bootstrap output ends), check whether `~/.claude/.ai-brain-starter-install-gaps.jsonl` exists.
2. For each line, run its `repair` command yourself, quietly. Most succeed on the second try minutes later.
3. On success for all gaps, delete the file and mention it in ONE positive sentence at a natural pause ("by the way, graphify finished setting up in the background — all good"). Never present a gap as an error, never ask the user to run anything, never show them the file.
4. If a repair still fails, leave its line in the file (the first-week check-in retries), keep the interview moving, and do not alarm the user — everything in that file is a component the setup runs fine without today.

---

### Step 0.2. Granola (DEFERRED — do NOT ask during install)

**Do NOT ask "Do you use Granola?" during setup.** Meeting-notes tooling is an optional integration, not an install question. Asking it cold, mid-install, is exactly the kind of friction a non-technical user abandons over — the same reason nano-banana (0.4) and GitHub (0.5) are deferred. Default the meeting workflow to MANUAL mode (store `NO_GRANOLA=true`) and move on silently. Don't mention Granola.

Surface it later ONLY if the user brings up meetings themselves ("pull my meeting notes", "I use Granola", "process this transcript"). At that moment, walk them through it:

1. **Check plan access first — Granola's API needs a paid Granola plan.** Have them open Granola → Settings → Connectors. If there is no **API keys** section, their plan has no API access; route them to Google Meet + Gemini, Otter, or manual notes instead.
2. With API access: "Generate an API key (Settings > Connectors > API keys), save it to `~/.config/granola/api-key` (chmod 600), then `python3 scripts/granola_sync.py --health` to verify and `--dry-run` to preview."
3. For auto-export every 2 hours, offer the LaunchAgent: set the script + log paths in `scripts/com.granola-export.plist`, copy to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, then `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.granola-export.plist`.
4. Store `GRANOLA=api` so the meeting workflow rule Globs for `*- Transcript.md` files.

---

### Step 0.3. Obsidian CLI confirmation

On Mac the bootstrap attempts a `/usr/local/bin/obsidian` symlink. Check whether it succeeded:

```bash
command -v obsidian >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "cli ok" || echo "cli missing"
```

If present, note it in the Phase 5 CLAUDE.md rules: *"Use Obsidian CLI for fast vault queries: search, backlinks, unresolved links, orphans, dead ends."*

If missing (older Obsidian, sudo declined, Windows, Linux without the CLI binary): skip silently. The vault works fine without it. Claude uses file search instead.

---

### Step 0.4. Nano-banana (DEFERRED, do not install in Phase 0)

The nano-banana skill folder is synced by bootstrap so `/nano-banana` is discoverable. The actual plugin binary plus Gemini API key setup is deferred until the user explicitly asks for image generation ("I want to generate an image", "can you make a logo", etc.). At that moment, walk them through it interactively:

1. "We need three things: the nano-banana plugin, a Gemini API key, and one environment variable. I'll do the first two with you and the third one for you."
2. "In this Claude Code window, type: `/plugin marketplace add devonjones/devon-claude-skills` and press Enter."
3. "Now type: `/plugin install nano-banana@devon-claude-skills` and press Enter."
4. "Now we need a free API key from Google. Go to https://ai.google.dev/, click 'Get API key' top-right, sign in with Google, click 'Create API key', copy the key (starts with 'AI'). Paste it back to me."
5. After they paste: write it to their shell profile for them.
   - Mac/Linux: append `export GEMINI_API_KEY="<key>"` to `~/.zshrc` and `~/.bash_profile`, source the active one.
   - Windows: `setx GEMINI_API_KEY "<key>"` so it persists.
6. "Done. Try '/nano-banana create a logo of a blue mountain' to test."

**Do NOT mention nano-banana during Phase 0.** Mentioning a feature the user didn't ask for and then walking them through API key setup as a "required step" is exactly the kind of friction non-technical users abandon over.

---

### Step 0.5. GitHub — no action needed

Bootstrap installs `gh` silently but does NOT prompt for auth. Connecting GitHub is never required. If the user asks about it later, say: "If you ever want it, just run `gh auth login` once and it'll wire up automatically." Don't mention it proactively.

---

### Step 0.6. Knowledge Graph CLAUDE.md rule (deferred until first /graphify run)

Once the user has run `/graphify` at least once and has `graphify-out/graph.json` plus `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`, their CLAUDE.md should include a Knowledge Graph rule pointing Claude there as the **primary** strategic context source. Draft template to append:

```markdown
## Knowledge Graph: CHECK THIS FIRST FOR STRATEGY / ANALYSIS

This vault has a knowledge graph at `graphify-out/`. It's the fastest and most accurate way to get strategic context. **For any question that spans multiple concepts, start here before reading individual files.**

**Context-loading decision tree:**

| Question type | Start with | Then drill into |
|---|---|---|
| Strategy / pitch / planning / multi-concept | `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` (god nodes + communities + hyperedges) | Top 3-5 source files in the relevant community |
| "What connects X and Y?" | `/graphify path "X" "Y"` | Shortest-path files |
| "What's in the vault about X?" | `/graphify explain "X"` | Top-degree neighbors |
| "Find files mentioning X" | `obsidian search query="X"` | Matching files |
| "What links to this file?" | `obsidian backlinks file="Name"` | Source of each backlink |
| Editing a specific file | `Read` the file directly | . |

**Rules:**
1. **For strategic or multi-concept questions, ALWAYS read `GRAPH_REPORT.md` first.** It compresses the vault's structural thinking.
2. **Use `/graphify query "<question>"` instead of reading 5 files** when you need a connected subgraph with source citations.
3. **Use `/graphify path "A" "B"` for cross-concept connections.**
4. **Update the graph after any significant writing session:** `/graphify <path> --update`. The cache makes incremental runs essentially free.
5. **When merging duplicate concept nodes, update aliases in the canonical file's frontmatter. Don't rename or delete.** This preserves existing `[[Old Name]]` wikilinks. See your vault's Graphify Runbook.
```

Skip this block if the user hasn't run `/graphify` yet. Mention it in the setup summary so they know to add it after the first run.

---

### Closing line

After Phase 0 completes cleanly:

> "I installed a few tools in the background that make everything faster and more efficient. Now let's get started with you."

Then proceed to Phase 1.
